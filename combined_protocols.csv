microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What pain medications should I stop before my microdiscectomy?,Can I take Aleve for a headache before my surgery?; Which over-the-counter pain meds are not allowed,"You must stop all NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) at least 7 days before your surgery. This includes Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), Naproxen (Aleve), Meloxicam, and Diclofenac. Tylenol (Acetaminophen) is generally safe to continue."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What about my blood thinners like Aspirin or Plavix?,Do I have to stop my daily low-dose aspirin?; What is the plan for my prescription blood thinner?,"It is essential that you discuss stopping any blood thinner (Aspirin, Plavix, Xarelto, Eliquis, Coumadin) with the prescribing doctor (e.g., your cardiologist). We will provide specific instructions based on their recommendations, but our standard protocol requires stopping them 5-7 days before surgery."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What about medications like Neurontin or Lyrica (gabapentin or pregabalin)?,Should I change the dose of my nerve medicine?; Is it safe to continue taking gabapentin?; Should I stop taking gabapentin?,"These are nerve medications and help to calm down irritated or excited nerves. If you are currently on one of these medications, you should not stop taking the med before surgery. Continue to take the medications through surgery until you are told to stop it by the surgeon. If you stop it too early, it can cause a rebound hypersensitivity."
microdiscectomy,Diet & Lifestyle,Do I need to stop eating or drinking before surgery?,What does it mean to be 'NPO'?; Can I have a mint or chew gum on the morning of surgery?,"Yes. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes water, coffee, and chewing gum. You may take approved morning medications with a small sip of water."
microdiscectomy,Day of Surgery,What should I wear to the hospital?,What are the best clothes to wear home from the hospital?; Are there any clothing recommendations for surgery day?,"Please wear loose, comfortable clothing that is easy to put on and take off, such as sweatpants and a zip-up or button-up shirt. Avoid anything that you have to pull tightly over your head."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,How much can I walk after my microdiscectomy?,What are my activity restrictions after the operation?; When can I start exercising again?,"Walking is your most important recovery activity. We want you up and walking the day of your surgery. Start with short, frequent walks around your house and gradually increase the distance each day as you feel comfortable."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,Are there any movements I should avoid after surgery?,What does 'BLT restrictions' mean?; Can I bend over to tie my shoes?,"Yes. For the first 4-6 weeks, you must avoid the ""BLTs"": Bending at the waist, Lifting more than 10 pounds (a gallon of milk), and Twisting your torso. The surgeon calls this his ""Spine Diet"" - you can eat a BLT but don't do a BLT!"
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What symptoms should I watch for that require an urgent call?,,"Please call our office immediately if you experience any of the following: fever over 101.5Â°F, new or worsening weakness in your legs or feet, loss of bowel or bladder control, or clear drainage from your incision that soaks the dressing."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,What is a microlumbar discectomy (MLD)?,,"A microlumbar discectomy, or MLD, is a minimally invasive surgery we perform to relieve pressure on the nerves in your lower back. ""Micro"" means small, ""lumbar"" refers to your lower back, and ""discectomy"" means to remove the part of the spinal disc that is causing the problem. We make a very small incision and gently separate the back muscles instead of cutting them, which helps you heal faster with less scarring. We approach the spine by placing a small tube between the muscle fibers - nothing is cut out. We use a microscope to look through this tube and into the spinal canal."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Will I be asleep for the surgery?,,"Yes, you will be completely asleep for the surgery. You will have what we call a general anesthesia. This is when the anesthesiologist gives you IV medication to make you fall alseep. You will have a small tube in your mouth to protect your airway and help you breathe while laying facedown during the surgery. Patients often do not remember anything about the surgery because of the medications that make you sleep."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,How do you get to spine?,,You will be face down on a special bed during the surgery. We have special memory foam pads to keep you comfortable in this position. We can then see you back and get to the spine through an incision that is often just the width of a thumb.
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Why do I need this surgery?,,"You're having this surgery because a spinal disc in your lower back has bulged or ruptured, and it's pressing on a nerve. This pressure is what causes the pain, numbness, or weakness you've been feeling in your leg, often called 'sciatica'. We've tried other treatments like medication and physical therapy without enough success, so this surgery is the next step to remove that pressure and relieve your symptoms."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Do you put anything back into the disc or refill it?,,"Unfortunately, once you have lost disc material there is currently no way to gain it back. Placing substances back into the disc to refill it could potentially lead to complications or a recurrent herniation."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Do you do anything to close the hole in the disc?,,Usually no. Multiple studies have been done evaluting this concept and found that the rate of recurrent herniation does not change. If anything these efforts to close the hole in the disc just lead to more scar tissue and higher rates of nerve injury or dural tears.
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,What is a dural tear or durotomy?,,"A durotomy or dural tear is when a small tear occurs in the lining of the nerve roots. This sac contains the spinal fluid. If there is a tear the spinal fluid can leak out. This can lead to headaches, photophobia (troubles being in bright light) or cause a persistent leakage of fluid through the incision which could lead to infection. The rate of this adverse event is very low. Call the surgeon immediately if you notice any of these symptoms. If you have a dural tear it is often treated with bedrest for a short time. It does not effect the success of the surgery in regards to improving the nerve symptoms."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Do you cut or remove any bone during this surgery?,,Not really. We sometimes shave a small area of bone in the interlaminar window (the hole in your spine that we access the nerves through) but this is often not required. Care is taken to avoid disrupting the bony stability of the spine.
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,How successful is this surgery?,,"This procedure is very effective, especially for relieving leg pain. It is about 95% successful in taking away the leg pain caused by a herniated disc."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,What are the risks of this surgery?,,"While this is a very safe procedure, every surgery has risks. The most common ones include a 5 to 10 percent chance that the disc could herniate again, a small risk of infection (about 1%), and an even smaller risk of a spinal fluid leak (about 3%). Serious nerve injury is very rare, happening in less than 1 out of every 1,000 surgeries. We will do everything we can to minimize these risks."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,What happens during the surgery?,,"You will be under general anesthesia, so you'll be asleep and comfortable. We will have you lying face down. Using an X-ray for guidance, I'll make a small incision in your back, about an inch long, directly over the problem area. Instead of cutting your back muscles, we use special tools to gently separate them. Through a small tube, and with the help of a microscope, I will remove the piece of the disc that is pressing on your nerve. Sometimes, I might remove a tiny bit of bone to get to the disc. Once the pressure is off the nerve, I'll remove the tube, your muscles will come back together, and I'll close the incision. The whole surgery usually takes about an hour."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,Will I need a blood transfusion?,,"It is very unusual for a patient to need blood during this type of surgery. The blood loss is typically very minimal, usually less than half a cup and often less than a tablespoon"
microdiscectomy,Before Surgery,What is a disc herniation?,,A disc herniation is when a piece of the disc (the soft tissue shock absorber between the bone blocks) squirts out and causes compression on a nerve root. This is what causes your leg pain or other symptoms. Think of the disc like a jelly donut in terms of its composition. It has a tougher fibrous outer layer and a softer jelly like core.
microdiscectomy,Before Surgery,How do I prepare for surgery?,,"Before your surgery, you'll have a medical check-up to make sure you're ready. It's important to stop taking certain medications and supplements that can thin your blood, like aspirin, anti-inflammatories (Ibuprofen, Aleve), and some herbal supplements, usually one to two weeks before your surgery. We will give you specific instructions on which ones to stop and when. Also, if you smoke, stopping now will significantly improve your healing and your chances of a successful outcome. On the day before surgery, we recommend eating light meals and not eating or drinking anything after midnight."
microdiscectomy,Before Surgery,Do I really need to stop smoking?,,"Yes, it's very important. Smoking slows down your body's ability to heal and increases your risk for infection. Quitting, even for a short time before surgery, makes a big difference and helps ensure you have the best possible result."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,How long will I be in the hospital?,,"This is an outpatient procedure, which means most patients go home on the same day as their surgery. We'll monitor you for a few hours after you wake up, and as long as your pain is controlled and you're medically stable, you can recover in the comfort of your own home."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,What kind of pain will I have after surgery?,,"You will likely feel immediate relief from the leg pain you had before. However, it's normal to have some new pain at the incision site for a few days or weeks. Your back muscles might also be sore or have spasms. We will give you prescriptions for pain medication to manage this. It's also normal for the nerve pain in your leg to flare up a bit as the nerve heals from being compressed, but this should improve over the next few weeks."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,When will my symptoms improve after surgery?,,"Pain is often improved almost immediately after the surgery. Weakness or numbness/tingling can take longer to recover. This is because the nerve roots have to ""wake up"" after being compressed. This often occurs within a few weeks from the surgery but in unusual situations it can take up to a year for full improvement. Sometimes, the nerve is really inflammed from the disc herniation and doing the surgery can aggravate it further. In these situations, new numbness or even pain can occur after surgery. If this happens to you, speak with the surgeon as there are means of alleviating this short lived increase of symptoms."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,How do I take care of my incision?,,"Keeping the incision clean and dry is the most important thing. You will have a waterproof dressing on it. You can shower, but don't soak in a bath or pool for about six weeks. Let the water run over the incision, but don't scrub it. Afterward, just pat it dry. Your stitches are under the skin and will dissolve on their own. Sometimes we use a special skin glue that will peel off by itself over time, so please don't pick at it."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,What are my activity restrictions?,,"For the first six weeks, we want you to avoid bending, lifting more than 10-15 pounds, and twisting your back. Walking is great for you! Start with short, frequent walks around your house and gradually increase the distance. You can usually return to office work and driving after a week, as long as you are no longer taking narcotic pain medication. We'll guide you on when you can return to more strenuous activities, usually around three months for heavy work."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,When can I drive?,When is it safe to get behind the wheel?; Is it okay for my family to drive me home?,You can start driving again once you are completely off of any prescription narcotic pain medications and you feel you can step on the brake quickly and without pain.
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,Will I need physical therapy?,Do I get a referral for PT?; What is the therapy plan after this surgery?; What kind of therapy do I need after surgery?,"Ususally no. Many patients benefit from physical therapy but it is not a requirement. Your preoperative functional status (how laid up you are) impacts this more than the type of surgery.. We typically start physical therapy about 6 weeks after your surgery to help you safely strengthen the muscles in and around your back and regain your mobility if its required. We dont want to cause injury prior to this. During the first six weeks, walking is your main mode of therapy."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,When is my first follow-up appointment?,,"We will schedule your first follow-up visit for about two weeks after your surgery. This appointment is mainly to check on your incision and see how you are progressing. Then we see you around 6 weeks after surgery to determine if you are ready to resume normal activities. That is often the last appointment for most patients. Of course, if you have any concerns prior to your first appointm, you can always call us."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,When should I call the doctor's office?,,"Please call us if you experience a fever, chills, redness or drainage from your incision, or increasing back or leg pain that isn't helped by rest and medication. You should also call us if you have new swelling or pain in your calf, or a severe headache that is worse when you're sitting up. If you have trouble breathing, call 911 immediately."
microdiscectomy,Foundational,Can you explain what my lumbar microdiscectomy surgery entails?,What is the purpose of this operation?; What are you trying to fix?,"In this procedure, we will make a small incision in your lower back to carefully remove the piece of the disc that has pushed out and is pinching the nerve. The primary aim is to take the pressure off that nerve, which should alleviate the pain or weakness you're feeling down your leg."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,Are there any over-the-counter pain relievers I need to avoid before my operation?,What about meds for a headache?; Is it okay to take Motrin?; Do I have to stop taking naproxen?,"For your safety, please avoid taking any NSAID medications for one full week prior to your scheduled surgery. This category includes common drugs like Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and Naproxen (Aleve). However, if you need pain relief, Tylenol (also known as Acetaminophen) is perfectly fine to use."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What is the protocol for my blood-thinning medication?,Do I have to stop my daily aspirin?; What's the plan for my Coumadin or Xarelto?,"Any medication that thins your blood requires special management. You must consult with the doctor who prescribed it (like your heart doctor) to get their approval to pause it. Typically, we ask patients to stop these medications 5 to 7 days before the operation, but we will follow the specific guidance from your prescribing physician."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,Do I make any changes to my nerve pain medicine like Gabapentin?,Should I stop taking Lyrica?; What's the plan for my pregabalin?,"Please continue taking your prescribed nerve-calming medications (such as Neurontin, Gabapentin, Lyrica, or Pregabalin) exactly as scheduled. Do not stop them. These medications help manage nerve sensitivity, and it's beneficial to maintain a stable level in your system."
microdiscectomy,Diet & Lifestyle,What are the rules about eating and drinking before my procedure?,When do I have to stop eating?; Can I have a sip of coffee in the morning?,"To ensure your safety during anesthesia, you must have a completely empty stomach. Please do not consume any food or beverages after midnight on the eve of your surgery. A small sip of water to take essential morning pills is the only exception."
microdiscectomy,Day of Surgery,What's the best type of clothing to wear on the day of surgery?,Are there any clothing recommendations?; What should I plan to wear home?,"We recommend choosing clothes that are loose-fitting and easy to manage. Think about items like sweatpants, shorts, and shirts that button or zip up the front. The key is to avoid anything tight or anything you have to pull over your head."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What's the plan for walking after the operation?,How soon can I get up and move?; Are there walking goals?,"Walking will be your primary form of therapy. We will have you up and moving on the very day of your surgery. The goal is to take short, regular walks, increasing your time and distance gradually as your comfort allows."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,Are there specific body movements I'm not allowed to do?,What does 'BLT restrictions' mean?; Is it okay to bend or twist?,"Yes, you must protect your back for the first 4 to 6 weeks by avoiding three specific movements, which we call the ""BLTs"": No Bending forward at the waist, no Lifting anything heavier than a gallon of milk (about 10 lbs), and no Twisting of your back."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,How long until I'm allowed to drive a car again?,When is it safe to get behind the wheel?; Can someone else drive me?,"You may not operate a vehicle as long as you are taking any narcotic pain relievers. You must feel confident that you can move your foot quickly to the brake without pain or hesitation. For most, this takes about 2 to 3 weeks. Riding as a passenger is fine anytime."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,How can I use the toilet without bending or twisting?,Is it hard to go to the bathroom after surgery?; How do I wipe myself?; What if my toilet is too low?,"Using the toilet is a normal activity, but you must be mindful of your BLT restrictions. To avoid excessive bending, consider using a raised toilet seat or a safety frame with arms that you can push up on. For personal hygiene, it is critical to avoid twisting your back. We highly recommend using a long-handled grabber or a specific personal hygiene wand to help you clean yourself safely without compromising your recovery."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What is the safest way to get out of bed or a chair?,,"To get out of bed, use the ""log roll"" technique: bend your knees, roll onto your side as one single unit (like a log), and then use your arms to push yourself up to a seated position as you swing your legs off the bed. To get out of a chair, scoot to the very edge of the seat, keep your back straight, and use the power of your legs and arms to push straight up. Remember your BLT restrictions: No Bending or Twisting. Using a walker for extra support and stability is a great idea in the first few days."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What is the typical timeline for returning to my job?,How much time should I take off work?; When can I go back to my office?,"Your return-to-work date is based on your job's physical demands. For office-based or sedentary work, 2 to 4 weeks is typical. For jobs requiring physical labor, you should plan for a longer recovery of 6 to 8 weeks, possibly more, to ensure your back has healed sufficiently."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,What are the instructions for showering with the incision?,How do I keep my incision clean?; Is it okay if soap and water run over the wound?,"You can let water from the shower run over your incision starting 48 hours after your procedure. It's important not to scrub the area directly. When you're done, gently pat the site dry with a fresh towel."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,Is it safe to take a bath or get in a pool?,When can I submerge my incision in water?; Can I use a jacuzzi?,"You must keep the incision out of standing water for 4 weeks. This means no baths, swimming pools, hot tubs, or lakes until the wound is fully healed and you've been cleared by the surgeon at your follow-up appointment."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,How should I manage the dressing on my wound?,What do I do with the surgical tape?; Should I peel off the glue?,"Your incision is sealed with either steri-strips (special tape) or a surgical glue called Dermabond. You don't need to do anything with it. Leave it in place, and it will start to come off on its own in about 10 to 14 days."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What should I expect in terms of pain after the procedure?,Is it normal for the leg pain to come and go?; Will my back hurt?,You should expect to feel some soreness at the incision site itself. It's also common for the nerve-related leg pain (sciatica) to fluctuate during the healing process as the nerve recovers. This is a normal part of recovery.
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What's the best strategy for taking my pain pills?,How do I use my narcotics effectively?; How do I wean off the pain medicine?,"For the first few days, it's best to take your pain medication on a regular schedule to prevent the pain from becoming severe. As you start to feel better, you can stretch out the time between doses and begin substituting with Tylenol."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What can I do to relieve constipation from the medication?,Is it normal to get backed up?; How do I treat constipation?,"It's very common to experience constipation from anesthesia and pain medicine. We suggest you begin taking an over-the-counter stool softener, like Colace, as soon as you start the narcotics. Staying hydrated and walking frequently are also very helpful."
microdiscectomy,Physical Therapy,Is a course of physical therapy required after this surgery?,Will I get a referral for PT?; What's the therapy plan?,"Formal physical therapy is not always necessary. For the initial 6 weeks, walking is the only therapy we recommend. At your 6-week check-up, we will assess your progress and decide if a PT referral would be beneficial for you."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,When will my first post-operative check-up be?,How soon do I come back to the clinic?; What is the purpose of the first visit?,Your first appointment back in our office will be scheduled for approximately two weeks after your surgery. The main purpose of this visit is to inspect your incision and ensure your initial recovery is on track. Your next key appointment is usually 6 weeks post-op.
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,How can I tell if my incision is getting infected?,What does an infected wound look like?; Is some redness okay?,"Please contact us if you see signs of infection, such as spreading redness, increased swelling, warmth to the touch, or any thick, cloudy, or colored discharge. A small amount of pinkish or clear fluid in the first day or so is not unusual."
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,Which symptoms are considered urgent and require a phone call?,What are the emergency signs?; When should I call the on-call doctor?,"Please call us immediately for any of these ""red flag"" symptoms: a temperature above 101.5Â°F (38.6Â°C), any new or progressing weakness in your leg or foot, or any change in your ability to control your bladder or bowels."
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What does it mean if I get a bad headache that's worse when I'm upright?,Is a positional headache a problem?; Why does my head pound when I stand up?,"If you experience a severe headache that feels significantly worse when you sit or stand and improves when you lie flat, you need to call our office. This specific type of headache can be a sign of a spinal fluid leak, which we need to know about."
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What should I do about new pain or swelling in my lower leg?,Is calf pain a warning sign?; What are the symptoms of a DVT?,"New pain, tenderness, swelling, or redness that appears in your calf muscle could be a sign of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or blood clot. This is a serious condition, so please contact our office right away if you notice these symptoms."
microdiscectomy,Foundational,What is a lumbar microdiscectomy?,Why am I having this surgery?; What does the operation do?,"A lumbar microdiscectomy is a minimally invasive surgery performed to remove the portion of a herniated disc in your lower back that is pressing on a nerve. The goal is to relieve the leg pain, numbness, or weakness caused by the nerve compression."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What pain medications should I stop before surgery?,Can I take Advil?; Is Ibuprofen okay?; What about Aleve?; Which pain meds are not allowed?,"You must stop all NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) at least 7 days before your surgery.

microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What movements should I avoid after surgery?,What are the BLTs?; Can I bend over?; How much can I lift?,"For the first 4-6 weeks, you must strictly avoid the ""BLTs"": Bending at the waist, Lifting more than 10 pounds (about the weight of a gallon of milk), and Twisting your torso."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,When can I drive?,When can I operate a vehicle?; Is it okay to be a passenger in a car?,"You cannot drive until you are completely off all narcotic pain medication and feel you can react safely in an emergency. For most patients, this is around 2-3 weeks. It is safe to be a passenger in a car for short trips immediately after surgery."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,When can I return to work?,How long am I off work?; When can I go back to my desk job?,"This depends on your job. If you have a sedentary desk job, you may be able to return in 2-4 weeks. If you have a physically demanding job that requires heavy lifting or manual labor, you may need to be off work for 6-8 weeks or longer."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,When can I shower after surgery?,Can I get my incision wet?; How long until I can shower?,"You may shower 48 hours after your surgery. Let the water run over the incision, but do not scrub it. Pat the area dry gently with a clean towel."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,Can I take a bath or go swimming?,Is it okay to submerge the incision?; Can I use a hot tub?,"No. Do not take a bath or submerge the incision in any water (pool, lake, hot tub) for at least 4 weeks, or until your incision is completely healed and you are cleared by your surgeon."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,What do I do about the dressing or surgical glue?,How do I care for the steri-strips?; When does the glue come off?,Your incision is covered with surgical glue (Dermabond) or steri-strips. Do not peel or pick at these. They will begin to peel off on their own in 10-14 days. You may trim any peeling edges if they are bothersome.
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What kind of pain is normal after surgery?,Will I still have leg pain?; Why does my back hurt at the incision?,"It is normal to have localized pain at the incision site. You may also notice that your original leg pain (sciatica) is gone, but it can sometimes reappear intermittently as the nerve recovers and inflammation subsides. This is normal."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,How should I use my prescribed pain medication?,How often should I take narcotics?; How do I manage my pain?,"The goal is to stay ahead of the pain for the first few days. Take your pain medication as prescribed. As you feel better, you can begin to increase the time between doses and then switch to Tylenol (Acetaminophen) as needed."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What should I do if I am constipated?,Is constipation normal after surgery?; How can I prevent constipation?,Constipation is a very common side effect of anesthesia and narcotic pain medication. We recommend starting an over-the-counter stool softener (like Colace) when you start taking narcotics. Drinking plenty of water and walking also helps.
microdiscectomy,Physical Therapy,Will I need physical therapy?,Do I need PT?; When does physical therapy start?,"Many patients do not require formal physical therapy.

If you are currently on one of these medications, you should not stop taking the med before surgery. Continue to take the medications through surgery until you are told to stop it by the surgeon. If you stop it too early, it can cause a rebound hypersensitivity."
microdiscectomy,Diet & Lifestyle,Do I need to stop eating or drinking before surgery?,What does it mean to be 'NPO'?; Can I have a mint or chew gum on the morning of surgery?,"Yes. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes water, coffee, and chewing gum. You may take approved morning medications with a small sip of water."
microdiscectomy,Day of Surgery,What should I wear to the hospital?,What are the best clothes to wear home from the hospital?; Are there any clothing recommendations for surgery day?,"Please wear loose, comfortable clothing that is easy to put on and take off, such as sweatpants and a zip-up or button-up shirt. Avoid anything that you have to pull tightly over your head."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,How much can I walk after my microdiscectomy?,What are my activity restrictions after the operation?; When can I start exercising again?,"Walking is your most important recovery activity. We want you up and walking the day of your surgery. Start with short, frequent walks around your house and gradually increase the distance each day as you feel comfortable."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,Are there any movements I should avoid after surgery?,What does 'BLT restrictions' mean?; Can I bend over to tie my shoes?,"Yes. For the first 4-6 weeks, you must avoid the ""BLTs"": Bending at the waist, Lifting more than 10 pounds (a gallon of milk), and Twisting your torso. The surgeon calls this his ""Spine Diet"" - you can eat a BLT but don't do a BLT!"
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What symptoms should I watch for that require an urgent call?,,"Please call our office immediately if you experience any of the following: fever over 101.5Â°F, new or worsening weakness in your legs or feet, loss of bowel or bladder control, or clear drainage from your incision that soaks the dressing."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,What is a microlumbar discectomy (MLD)?,What is this?; What am i having done?,"A microlumbar discectomy, or MLD, is a minimally invasive surgery we perform to relieve pressure on the nerves in your lower back. ""Micro"" means small, ""lumbar"" refers to your lower back, and ""discectomy"" means to remove the part of the spinal disc that is causing the problem. We make a very small incision and gently separate the back muscles instead of cutting them, which helps you heal faster with less scarring. We approach the spine by placing a small tube between the muscle fibers - nothing is cut out. We use a microscope to look through this tube and into the spinal canal."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Will I be asleep for the surgery?,,"Yes, you will be completely asleep for the surgery. You will have what we call a general anesthesia. This is when the anesthesiologist gives you IV medication to make you fall alseep. You will have a small tube in your mouth to protect your airway and help you breathe while laying facedown during the surgery. Patients often do not remember anything about the surgery because of the medications that make you sleep."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,How do you get to spine?,,You will be face down on a special bed during the surgery. We have special memory foam pads to keep you comfortable in this position. We can then see you back and get to the spine through an incision that is often just the width of a thumb.
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Why do I need this surgery?,,"You're having this surgery because a spinal disc in your lower back has bulged or ruptured, and it's pressing on a nerve. This pressure is what causes the pain, numbness, or weakness you've been feeling in your leg, often called 'sciatica'. We've tried other treatments like medication and physical therapy without enough success, so this surgery is the next step to remove that pressure and relieve your symptoms."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Do you put anything back into the disc or refill it?,,"Unfortunately, once you have lost disc material there is currently no way to gain it back. Placing substances back into the disc to refill it could potentially lead to complications or a recurrent herniation."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Do you do anything to close the hole in the disc?,,Usually no. Multiple studies have been done evaluting this concept and found that the rate of recurrent herniation does not change. If anything these efforts to close the hole in the disc just lead to more scar tissue and higher rates of nerve injury or dural tears.
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,What is a dural tear or durotomy?,,"A durotomy or dural tear is when a small tear occurs in the lining of the nerve roots. This sac contains the spinal fluid. If there is a tear the spinal fluid can leak out. This can lead to headaches, photophobia (troubles being in bright light) or cause a persistent leakage of fluid through the incision which could lead to infection. The rate of this adverse event is very low. Call the surgeon immediately if you notice any of these symptoms. If you have a dural tear it is often treated with bedrest for a short time. It does not effect the success of the surgery in regards to improving the nerve symptoms."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Do you cut or remove any bone during this surgery?,,Not really. We sometimes shave a small area of bone in the interlaminar window (the hole in your spine that we access the nerves through) but this is often not required. Care is taken to avoid disrupting the bony stability of the spine.
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,How successful is this surgery?,,"This procedure is very effective, especially for relieving leg pain. It is about 95% successful in taking away the leg pain caused by a herniated disc."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,What are the risks of this surgery?,,"While this is a very safe procedure, every surgery has risks. The most common ones include a 5 to 10 percent chance that the disc could herniate again, a small risk of infection (about 1%), and an even smaller risk of a spinal fluid leak (about 3%). Serious nerve injury is very rare, happening in less than 1 out of every 1,000 surgeries. We will do everything we can to minimize these risks."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,What happens during the surgery?,,"You will be under general anesthesia, so you'll be asleep and comfortable. We will have you lying face down. Using an X-ray for guidance, I'll make a small incision in your back, about an inch long, directly over the problem area. Instead of cutting your back muscles, we use special tools to gently separate them. Through a small tube, and with the help of a microscope, I will remove the piece of the disc that is pressing on your nerve. Sometimes, I might remove a tiny bit of bone to get to the disc. Once the pressure is off the nerve, I'll remove the tube, your muscles will come back together, and I'll close the incision. The whole surgery usually takes about an hour."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,Will I need a blood transfusion?,,"It is very unusual for a patient to need blood during this type of surgery. The blood loss is typically very minimal, usually less than half a cup and often less than a tablespoon"
microdiscectomy,Before Surgery,What is a disc herniation?,,A disc herniation is when a piece of the disc (the soft tissue shock absorber between the bone blocks) squirts out and causes compression on a nerve root. This is what causes your leg pain or other symptoms. Think of the disc like a jelly donut in terms of its composition. It has a tougher fibrous outer layer and a softer jelly like core.
microdiscectomy,Before Surgery,How do I prepare for surgery?,,"Before your surgery, you'll have a medical check-up to make sure you're ready. It's important to stop taking certain medications and supplements that can thin your blood, like aspirin, anti-inflammatories (Ibuprofen, Aleve), and some herbal supplements, usually one to two weeks before your surgery. We will give you specific instructions on which ones to stop and when. Also, if you smoke, stopping now will significantly improve your healing and your chances of a successful outcome. On the day before surgery, we recommend eating light meals and not eating or drinking anything after midnight."
microdiscectomy,Before Surgery,Do I really need to stop smoking?,,"Yes, it's very important. Smoking slows down your body's ability to heal and increases your risk for infection. Quitting, even for a short time before surgery, makes a big difference and helps ensure you have the best possible result."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,How long will I be in the hospital?,,"This is an outpatient procedure, which means most patients go home on the same day as their surgery. We'll monitor you for a few hours after you wake up, and as long as your pain is controlled and you're medically stable, you can recover in the comfort of your own home."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,What kind of pain will I have after surgery?,,"You will likely feel immediate relief from the leg pain you had before. However, it's normal to have some new pain at the incision site for a few days or weeks. Your back muscles might also be sore or have spasms. We will give you prescriptions for pain medication to manage this. It's also normal for the nerve pain in your leg to flare up a bit as the nerve heals from being compressed, but this should improve over the next few weeks."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,When will my symptoms improve after surgery?,,"Pain is often improved almost immediately after the surgery. Weakness or numbness/tingling can take longer to recover. This is because the nerve roots have to ""wake up"" after being compressed. This often occurs within a few weeks from the surgery but in unusual situations it can take up to a year for full improvement. Sometimes, the nerve is really inflammed from the disc herniation and doing the surgery can aggravate it further. In these situations, new numbness or even pain can occur after surgery. If this happens to you, speak with the surgeon as there are means of alleviating this short lived increase of symptoms."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,How do I take care of my incision?,,"Keeping the incision clean and dry is the most important thing. You will have a waterproof dressing on it. You can shower, but don't soak in a bath or pool for about six weeks. Let the water run over the incision, but don't scrub it. Afterward, just pat it dry. Your stitches are under the skin and will dissolve on their own. Sometimes we use a special skin glue that will peel off by itself over time, so please don't pick at it."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,What are my activity restrictions?,,"For the first six weeks, we want you to avoid bending, lifting more than 10-15 pounds, and twisting your back. Walking is great for you! Start with short, frequent walks around your house and gradually increase the distance. You can usually return to office work and driving after a week, as long as you are no longer taking narcotic pain medication. We'll guide you on when you can return to more strenuous activities, usually around three months for heavy work."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,When can I drive?,When is it safe to get behind the wheel?; Is it okay for my family to drive me home?,You can start driving again once you are completely off of any prescription narcotic pain medications and you feel you can step on the brake quickly and without pain.
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,Will I need physical therapy?,Do I get a referral for PT?; What is the therapy plan after this surgery?; What kind of therapy do I need after surgery?,"Ususally no. Many patients benefit from physical therapy but it is not a requirement. Your preoperative functional status (how laid up you are) impacts this more than the type of surgery.. We typically start physical therapy about 6 weeks after your surgery to help you safely strengthen the muscles in and around your back and regain your mobility if its required. We dont want to cause injury prior to this. During the first six weeks, walking is your main mode of therapy."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,When is my first follow-up appointment?,,"We will schedule your first follow-up visit for about two weeks after your surgery. This appointment is mainly to check on your incision and see how you are progressing. Then we see you around 6 weeks after surgery to determine if you are ready to resume normal activities. That is often the last appointment for most patients. Of course, if you have any concerns prior to your first appointm, you can always call us."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,When should I call the doctor's office?,,"Please call us if you experience a fever, chills, redness or drainage from your incision, or increasing back or leg pain that isn't helped by rest and medication. You should also call us if you have new swelling or pain in your calf, or a severe headache that is worse when you're sitting up. If you have trouble breathing, call 911 immediately."
microdiscectomy,Foundational,Can you explain what my lumbar microdiscectomy surgery entails?,What is the purpose of this operation?; What are you trying to fix?,"In this procedure, we will make a small incision in your lower back to carefully remove the piece of the disc that has pushed out and is pinching the nerve. The primary aim is to take the pressure off that nerve, which should alleviate the pain or weakness you're feeling down your leg."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,Are there any over-the-counter pain relievers I need to avoid before my operation?,What about meds for a headache?; Is it okay to take Motrin?; Do I have to stop taking naproxen?,"For your safety, please avoid taking any NSAID medications for one full week prior to your scheduled surgery. This category includes common drugs like Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and Naproxen (Aleve). However, if you need pain relief, Tylenol (also known as Acetaminophen) is perfectly fine to use."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What is the protocol for my blood-thinning medication?,Do I have to stop my daily aspirin?; What's the plan for my Coumadin or Xarelto?,"Any medication that thins your blood requires special management. You must consult with the doctor who prescribed it (like your heart doctor) to get their approval to pause it. Typically, we ask patients to stop these medications 5 to 7 days before the operation, but we will follow the specific guidance from your prescribing physician."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,Do I make any changes to my nerve pain medicine like Gabapentin?,Should I stop taking Lyrica?; What's the plan for my pregabalin?,"Please continue taking your prescribed nerve-calming medications (such as Neurontin, Gabapentin, Lyrica, or Pregabalin) exactly as scheduled. Do not stop them. These medications help manage nerve sensitivity, and it's beneficial to maintain a stable level in your system."
microdiscectomy,Diet & Lifestyle,What are the rules about eating and drinking before my procedure?,When do I have to stop eating?; Can I have a sip of coffee in the morning?,"To ensure your safety during anesthesia, you must have a completely empty stomach. Please do not consume any food or beverages after midnight on the eve of your surgery. A small sip of water to take essential morning pills is the only exception."
microdiscectomy,Day of Surgery,What's the best type of clothing to wear on the day of surgery?,Are there any clothing recommendations?; What should I plan to wear home?,"We recommend choosing clothes that are loose-fitting and easy to manage. Think about items like sweatpants, shorts, and shirts that button or zip up the front. The key is to avoid anything tight or anything you have to pull over your head."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What's the plan for walking after the operation?,How soon can I get up and move?; Are there walking goals?,"Walking will be your primary form of therapy. We will have you up and moving on the very day of your surgery. The goal is to take short, regular walks, increasing your time and distance gradually as your comfort allows."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,Are there specific body movements I'm not allowed to do?,What does 'BLT restrictions' mean?; Is it okay to bend or twist?,"Yes, you must protect your back for the first 4 to 6 weeks by avoiding three specific movements, which we call the ""BLTs"": No Bending forward at the waist, no Lifting anything heavier than a gallon of milk (about 10 lbs), and no Twisting of your back."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,How long until I'm allowed to drive a car again?,When is it safe to get behind the wheel?; Can someone else drive me?,"You may not operate a vehicle as long as you are taking any narcotic pain relievers. You must feel confident that you can move your foot quickly to the brake without pain or hesitation. For most, this takes about 2 to 3 weeks. Riding as a passenger is fine anytime."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,How can I use the toilet without bending or twisting?,Is it hard to go to the bathroom after surgery?; How do I wipe myself?; What if my toilet is too low?,"Using the toilet is a normal activity, but you must be mindful of your BLT restrictions. To avoid excessive bending, consider using a raised toilet seat or a safety frame with arms that you can push up on. For personal hygiene, it is critical to avoid twisting your back. We highly recommend using a long-handled grabber or a specific personal hygiene wand to help you clean yourself safely without compromising your recovery."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What is the safest way to get out of bed or a chair?,,"To get out of bed, use the ""log roll"" technique: bend your knees, roll onto your side as one single unit (like a log), and then use your arms to push yourself up to a seated position as you swing your legs off the bed. To get out of a chair, scoot to the very edge of the seat, keep your back straight, and use the power of your legs and arms to push straight up. Remember your BLT restrictions: No Bending or Twisting. Using a walker for extra support and stability is a great idea in the first few days."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What is the typical timeline for returning to my job?,How much time should I take off work?; When can I go back to my office?,"Your return-to-work date is based on your job's physical demands. For office-based or sedentary work, 2 to 4 weeks is typical. For jobs requiring physical labor, you should plan for a longer recovery of 6 to 8 weeks, possibly more, to ensure your back has healed sufficiently."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,What are the instructions for showering with the incision?,How do I keep my incision clean?; Is it okay if soap and water run over the wound?,"You can let water from the shower run over your incision starting 48 hours after your procedure. It's important not to scrub the area directly. When you're done, gently pat the site dry with a fresh towel."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,Is it safe to take a bath or get in a pool?,When can I submerge my incision in water?; Can I use a jacuzzi?,"You must keep the incision out of standing water for 4 weeks. This means no baths, swimming pools, hot tubs, or lakes until the wound is fully healed and you've been cleared by the surgeon at your follow-up appointment."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,How should I manage the dressing on my wound?,What do I do with the surgical tape?; Should I peel off the glue?,"Your incision is sealed with either steri-strips (special tape) or a surgical glue called Dermabond. You don't need to do anything with it. Leave it in place, and it will start to come off on its own in about 10 to 14 days."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What should I expect in terms of pain after the procedure?,Is it normal for the leg pain to come and go?; Will my back hurt?,You should expect to feel some soreness at the incision site itself. It's also common for the nerve-related leg pain (sciatica) to fluctuate during the healing process as the nerve recovers. This is a normal part of recovery.
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What's the best strategy for taking my pain pills?,How do I use my narcotics effectively?; How do I wean off the pain medicine?,"For the first few days, it's best to take your pain medication on a regular schedule to prevent the pain from becoming severe. As you start to feel better, you can stretch out the time between doses and begin substituting with Tylenol."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What can I do to relieve constipation from the medication?,Is it normal to get backed up?; How do I treat constipation?,"It's very common to experience constipation from anesthesia and pain medicine. We suggest you begin taking an over-the-counter stool softener, like Colace, as soon as you start the narcotics. Staying hydrated and walking frequently are also very helpful."
microdiscectomy,Physical Therapy,Is a course of physical therapy required after this surgery?,Will I get a referral for PT?; What's the therapy plan?,"Formal physical therapy is not always necessary. For the initial 6 weeks, walking is the only therapy we recommend. At your 6-week check-up, we will assess your progress and decide if a PT referral would be beneficial for you."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,When will my first post-operative check-up be?,How soon do I come back to the clinic?; What is the purpose of the first visit?,Your first appointment back in our office will be scheduled for approximately two weeks after your surgery.

microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,How can I tell if my incision is getting infected?,What does an infected wound look like?; Is some redness okay?,"Please contact us if you see signs of infection, such as spreading redness, increased swelling, warmth to the touch, or any thick, cloudy, or colored discharge. A small amount of pinkish or clear fluid in the first day or so is not unusual."
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,Which symptoms are considered urgent and require a phone call?,What are the emergency signs?; When should I call the on-call doctor?,"Please call us immediately for any of these ""red flag"" symptoms: a temperature above 101.5Â°F (38.6Â°C), any new or progressing weakness in your leg or foot, or any change in your ability to control your bladder or bowels."
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What does it mean if I get a bad headache that's worse when I'm upright?,Is a positional headache a problem?; Why does my head pound when I stand up?,"If you experience a severe headache that feels significantly worse when you sit or stand and improves when you lie flat, you need to call our office. This specific type of headache can be a sign of a spinal fluid leak, which we need to know about."
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What should I do about new pain or swelling in my lower leg?,Is calf pain a warning sign?; What are the symptoms of a DVT?,"New pain, tenderness, swelling, or redness that appears in your calf muscle could be a sign of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or blood clot. This is a serious condition, so please contact our office right away if you notice these symptoms."
microdiscectomy,Foundational,What is a lumbar microdiscectomy?,Why am I having this surgery?; What does the operation do?,"A lumbar microdiscectomy is a minimally invasive surgery performed to remove the portion of a herniated disc in your lower back that is pressing on a nerve. The goal is to relieve the leg pain, numbness, or weakness caused by the nerve compression."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What pain medications should I stop before surgery?,Can I take Advil?; Is Ibuprofen okay?; What about Aleve?; Which pain meds are not allowed?,"You must stop all NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) at least 7 days before your surgery.

Avoid anything that you have to pull tightly over your head."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,How much should I walk after surgery?,When can I start walking?; How far should I walk?,"Walking is your most important recovery activity. We want you up and walking the same day as your surgery. Start with short, frequent walks inside your house and gradually increase the distance each day as you feel comfortable."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What movements should I avoid after surgery?,What are the BLTs?; Can I bend over?; How much can I lift?,"For the first 4-6 weeks, you must strictly avoid the ""BLTs"": Bending at the waist, Lifting more than 10 pounds (about the weight of a gallon of milk), and Twisting your torso."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,When can I drive?,When can I operate a vehicle?; Is it okay to be a passenger in a car?,"You cannot drive until you are completely off all narcotic pain medication and feel you can react safely in an emergency. For most patients, this is around 2-3 weeks. It is safe to be a passenger in a car for short trips immediately after surgery."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,When can I return to work?,How long am I off work?; When can I go back to my desk job?,"This depends on your job. If you have a sedentary desk job, you may be able to return in 2-4 weeks. If you have a physically demanding job that requires heavy lifting or manual labor, you may need to be off work for 6-8 weeks or longer."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,When can I shower after surgery?,Can I get my incision wet?; How long until I can shower?,"You may shower 48 hours after your surgery. Let the water run over the incision, but do not scrub it. Pat the area dry gently with a clean towel."

microdiscectomy,Incision Care,What do I do about the dressing or surgical glue?,How do I care for the steri-strips?; When does the glue come off?,Your incision is covered with surgical glue (Dermabond) or steri-strips. Do not peel or pick at these. They will begin to peel off on their own in 10-14 days. You may trim any peeling edges if they are bothersome.
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What kind of pain is normal after surgery?,Will I still have leg pain?; Why does my back hurt at the incision?,"It is normal to have localized pain at the incision site. You may also notice that your original leg pain (sciatica) is gone, but it can sometimes reappear intermittently as the nerve recovers and inflammation subsides. This is normal."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,How should I use my prescribed pain medication?,How often should I take narcotics?; How do I manage my pain?,"The goal is to stay ahead of the pain for the first few days. Take your pain medication as prescribed. As you feel better, you can begin to increase the time between doses and then switch to Tylenol (Acetaminophen) as needed."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What should I do if I am constipated?,Is constipation normal after surgery?; How can I prevent constipation?,Constipation is a very common side effect of anesthesia and narcotic pain medication. We recommend starting an over-the-counter stool softener (like Colace) when you start taking narcotics. Drinking plenty of water and walking also helps.
microdiscectomy,Physical Therapy,Will I need physical therapy?,Do I need PT?; When does physical therapy start?,"Many patients do not require formal physical therapy. Walking is your main therapy for the first 6 weeks. If you still have weakness or mobility issues at your 6-week follow-up, we will discuss if physical therapy is the right next step for you."

microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What if I have new pain or swelling in my calf?,Why does my leg hurt?; Could this be a blood clot?,"If you develop new, persistent pain, swelling, or redness in one of your calves (not related to your incision), this could be a sign of a blood clot (DVT). Please call our office right away."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Will this surgery fix my back pain?,"- Is this going to cure my lower backache? <br>- I thought this was for my leg, will my back feel better too? <br>- What's the main goal of this operation, back or leg pain?","The primary goal of this surgery is to relieve the leg pain, numbness, or weaknessâthe ""sciatica""âcaused by the pinched nerve. While some patients do experience an improvement in their back pain, it is not the main purpose of the procedure, and we cannot guarantee your back pain will resolve."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,How big will my scar be?,- Will I have a large incision? <br>- What will the scar look like after a microdiscectomy? <br>- Is the cut very noticeable?,"The incision is very small, typically less than an inch long. We make it as discreetly as possible. Over time, it will fade and for most patients, it becomes a very fine line that is not very noticeable."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,What happens if I don't have the surgery?,- What are the risks of waiting? <br>- Can my condition get worse without the operation? <br>- Is surgery my only option?,"If the nerve remains pinched, your leg pain, numbness, or weakness could become more severe or even permanent. While other treatments like physical therapy and injections can help, if they haven't provided enough relief, surgery is the most effective way to prevent long-term nerve damage."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Is this considered major surgery?,- How serious is a microdiscectomy? <br>- Would you classify this as a big operation? <br>- Am I undergoing a major procedure?,"While any surgery is a significant event, a microdiscectomy is considered a minimally invasive and very common procedure. It's not ""open"" back surgery. The small incision and muscle-sparing technique lead to a much faster recovery compared to traditional methods."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,How long does the actual operation take?,- How many hours will I be in surgery? <br>- What is the duration of the procedure? <br>- How long will the surgeon be operating?,"The surgery itself is quite quick, usually taking about an hour from the first incision to the last stitch."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,Will I have stitches that need to be removed?,- Do I have to come back to get stitches out? <br>- What kind of sutures do you use? <br>- Are the stitches dissolvable?,"We use sutures that are all underneath the skin and they will dissolve on their own, so you won't need to have any stitches removed at your follow-up appointment. We also use a special skin glue that will peel off over time."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,Will I be able to feel anything during the surgery?,- What kind of anesthesia will I have? <br>- Will I be awake at all? <br>- Is it possible to wake up during the operation?,"No, you will be completely asleep under general anesthesia. You will not feel or remember anything about the procedure itself. Our anesthesia team will be monitoring you closely the entire time to ensure you are safe and comfortable."
microdiscectomy,Risks & Complications,What is the chance the disc will herniate again?,- Could this problem come back? <br>- How likely is a re-herniation? <br>- Can the disc slip again after surgery?,There is a 5 to 10 percent chance that the same disc could herniate again in the future. Following your post-operative restrictions and using good body mechanics for lifting can help reduce this risk.
microdiscectomy,Risks & Complications,What is a spinal fluid leak?,"- You mentioned a dural tear, what is that? <br>- Is a CSF leak dangerous? <br>- What happens if the sac around the nerves is torn?","The nerves in your spine are contained in a sac filled with spinal fluid. It's possible, though rare (about a 3% chance), for this sac to get nicked during surgery, causing a leak. It is not dangerous and is usually repaired right away during the procedure. It may require you to lie flat for a day or two after surgery to ensure it heals completely."
microdiscectomy,Risks & Complications,How will you protect my nerves during surgery?,- Is there a risk of nerve damage? <br>- What do you do to make sure the nerves are safe? <br>- Can the surgery make my leg pain worse?,"Nerve injury is the risk we take most seriously, but it is extremely rare, occurring in less than 1 in 1,000 surgeries. We use a microscope for a magnified view and very precise instruments. The goal is to gently free the nerve from pressure, and we handle it with the utmost care."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,How soon will my leg pain be gone?,- Will I wake up without pain? <br>- When will the sciatica stop? <br>- Is the relief from leg pain immediate?,"Most patients notice an immediate and significant relief of their leg pain right after they wake up from surgery. It's important to remember that the nerve has been pinched and needs time to heal, so some residual numbness or tingling can take a few weeks to fully disappear."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,Will I need a walker or a cane?,- Will I have trouble walking after surgery? <br>- Do I need any special equipment at home? <br>- Can I walk on my own right away?,The vast majority of patients are able to walk on their own without any assistance shortly after surgery. We will have you up and walking before you leave the hospital. A walker or cane is not typically needed.
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,How should I sleep?,- What is the best sleeping position after back surgery? <br>- Can I sleep on my stomach? <br>- Do I need a special pillow?,"The best positions are on your back with a pillow under your knees, or on your side with a pillow between your knees. This helps keep your spine in a neutral, comfortable position. We advise against sleeping on your stomach."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,When can I go back to work?,- How much time do I need to take off? <br>- What is the recovery time before returning to my job? <br>- When am I cleared to work again?,"This depends on the type of work you do. If you have a desk job, you may be able to return in as little as one to two weeks. If your job is more physically demanding, you may need six weeks for moderate duty and up to three months for heavy labor."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,When can I resume sexual activity?,- Is it safe to have sex after my surgery? <br>- How long should I wait to be intimate? <br>- Are there any restrictions on sexual relations?,You can typically resume sexual activity whenever you feel comfortable. Listen to your body and avoid positions that cause pain or strain your back. The safest position is generally lying flat on your back.
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,Will I need to wear a back brace?,- Do I get a brace after this surgery? <br>- Is a back support required? <br>- Will you be fitting me for a brace?,"No, a back brace is not typically needed after a standard microdiscectomy."
microdiscectomy,Pain Management,How much pain will I be in after the surgery?,- Is the recovery very painful? <br>- What is the post-op pain like? <br>- How bad does it hurt after the operation?,"You will have some ""incisional"" pain at the site of the surgery, which is different from the nerve pain you had before. This is normal and well-controlled with the pain medication we prescribe. Most patients find this surgical soreness manageable and it improves significantly over the first few days."
microdiscectomy,Pain Management,For how long will I need to take narcotic pain medicine?,- How long will I be on the strong pain pills? <br>- When can I switch to Tylenol? <br>- Do most people need narcotics for weeks?,"Most patients only need to take the narcotic pain medication for a few days, up to a week. We encourage you to switch to over-the-counter Tylenol as soon as your pain allows."
microdiscectomy,Pain Management,What are the side effects of the pain medication?,- Do the pain pills make you sick? <br>- What should I watch out for with narcotics? <br>- Are there common problems with the pain medicine?,"The most common side effects of narcotic pain medications are drowsiness, nausea, and constipation. It is very important to take a stool softener while you are taking them to avoid constipation. Do not drive or operate machinery while taking them."
microdiscectomy,Activity & Recovery,When can I shower?,- How long do I have to wait to wash? <br>- Is the incision waterproof? <br>- Can I get my back wet?,"You can shower two or three days after your surgery. You should let the water run over the incision but avoid scrubbing it. After, gently pat the area dry. You should not take a bath or go swimming for about six weeks."
microdiscectomy,Activity & Recovery,"What does ""no bending, lifting, or twisting"" really mean?",- Can you give me examples of what I can't do? <br>- How strict are the BLT restrictions? <br>- What movements should I avoid?,"It means you should not bend at the waist to pick things up, lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk (about 8-10 lbs), or twist your torso like you're swinging a golf club. When you need to pick something up, bend with your knees and keep your back straight."
microdiscectomy,Activity & Recovery,When can I start exercising again?,- When can I go back to the gym? <br>- What kind of exercise is safe to do? <br>- How soon can I work out?,"Walking is your most important exercise, and you should start right away. You can gradually increase your distance. We will likely prescribe physical therapy a few weeks after surgery to guide you in strengthening your core. More strenuous gym activities are usually not permitted until after the six-week mark."
microdiscectomy,Activity & Recovery,How much walking should I do?,- What's a good walking goal after surgery? <br>- Is it possible to walk too much? <br>- Can you give me a walking schedule?,"Start with short, frequent walks inside your home for the first week. By the third week, you should aim for about half a mile per day, and by the fourth week, up to a mile per day. It's best to break this up into several shorter walks. Listen to your body; if you feel sharp pain, it's time to rest."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,What happens at my first follow-up appointment?,- What should I expect at my two-week check-up? <br>- Why do I need to come back after two weeks? <br>- What is the purpose of the first post-op visit?,"The first appointment, usually two weeks after surgery, is primarily a wound check. We'll inspect your incision to make sure it's healing well. It's also a great opportunity for you to ask any questions that have come up since you've been home."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,"Will I need more imaging, like an MRI?",- Do I need another MRI after surgery? <br>- Will you take x-rays? <br>- How do you check if the surgery worked?,"We do not typically need to get another MRI after surgery unless new symptoms develop. We may take an x-ray at your follow-up appointments, but the best way to know the surgery was successful is the relief of your leg symptoms."
acdf,About the Procedure,What is an Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF)?,- Can you explain what an ACDF surgery is? <br>- What does ACDF stand for and what does it mean?,"An ACDF is a type of neck surgery performed to relieve pressure on your spinal cord or nerves. We go in through the front of your neck, which is the ""Anterior"" part. Then, we remove the damaged discâthat's the ""Discectomy."" Finally, we encourage the two vertebrae to grow together into one solid bone, which is the ""Fusion."" This process stabilizes your spine and prevents the painful pressure from coming back."
acdf,About the Procedure,Why do I need to have this surgery?,- What condition does this surgery treat? <br>- Why is an ACDF recommended for me?,"You are having this surgery because a disc or a bone spur in your neck is pressing on your spinal nerves or even the spinal cord itself. This pressure is what causes symptoms like pain in your neck or arms, numbness and tingling in your fingers, weakness, or even problems with coordination and balance. The goal of the surgery is to remove that pressure and give your nerves the space they need."
acdf,The Surgery,What happens during the operation?,- Can you walk me through the surgical process? <br>- What should I expect when I'm in the operating room?,"You will be comfortably asleep under general anesthesia. I will make a small incision in a natural crease on the front of your neck. I'll gently move the throat structures aside to access your spine. Using a microscope, I will remove the damaged disc and any bone spurs that are pinching the nerves. Then, I'll place a small spacer filled with bone graft material into the empty disc space. To hold everything securely while it heals, I'll attach a small titanium plate and screws. The incision is then closed with stitches that dissolve on their own."
acdf,The Surgery,Where does the bone for the fusion come from?,- Will you have to take bone from my hip? <br>- What is the bone graft made of?,"We use a combination of materials to help your bones fuse. This includes using some of your own bone that is collected during the procedure itself, as well as a sterilized bone product from a tissue bank. In the past, it was common to take bone from a patient's hip, but we rarely need to do that anymore, which avoids the pain that used to be associated with it."
acdf,Risks & Complications,What are the risks involved with this surgery?,- Is ACDF surgery dangerous? <br>- What are the potential complications I should know about?,"While ACDF is a very safe and common procedure, all surgeries have risks. The most common side effects are temporary and include a sore throat, hoarseness, and some difficulty swallowing for a few weeks. More serious complications are very rare but can include bleeding, infection, injury to the vocal cords, or the bones not fusing properly, which might require another surgery. We take every precaution to minimize these risks."
acdf,Preparation,How do I need to prepare for my surgery?,- What do I need to do before the operation? <br>- Is there a pre-op checklist I should follow?,"Before surgery, you'll get a medical clearance from your primary doctor. It's very important that you stop taking any anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or Aleve, as well as any blood thinners, for one to two weeks before the procedure. If you smoke, you must stop, as it can prevent your bones from fusing. The night before, don't eat or drink anything after midnight. We'll give you a detailed list of instructions to follow."
acdf,Preparation,Why is it so important for me to stop smoking?,- Does smoking really affect the surgery outcome? <br>- What happens if I smoke before or after my fusion?,"Yes, it is absolutely critical. Nicotine severely restricts your blood vessels, which reduces the blood flow and oxygen that your bones need to heal and fuse together. Smoking cuts the chances of a successful fusion in half. For the best possible outcome, you need to stop smoking at least two weeks before surgery and stay smoke-free for at least three months afterward."
acdf,After Surgery,What can I expect right after I wake up from surgery?,- How will I feel immediately after the operation? <br>- Will I be in a lot of pain when I wake up?,"It's normal to have some neck and shoulder pain, as well as muscle spasms, which we will manage with medication. Many patients notice that the nerve pain in their arm is gone right away. You will likely have a sore throat and some difficulty swallowing, which is very common. Most patients stay in the hospital for one night for observation."
acdf,After Surgery,Will I have trouble swallowing?,- Is a sore throat normal after this surgery? <br>- What can I do if it's hard to swallow?,"Yes, difficulty swallowing is a very common and expected side effect. It happens because we have to gently move your esophagus and windpipe during surgery, which causes some temporary swelling. It's usually at its worst about 3 to 5 days after surgery. Eating soft foods and drinking cold things like ice water, ice cream, or smoothies can help a lot. This will get better over the next few weeks."
acdf,After Surgery,How do I take care of my incision?,- What are the instructions for wound care? <br>- When can I take the bandage off?,"Your incision will be covered with a waterproof dressing and skin glue. You can shower the day after surgery, but don't scrub the area. Just let water run over it and gently pat it dry. The dressing can usually be removed after 24 to 48 hours. Don't pick at the skin glue; it will dissolve and come off on its own. Do not put any creams or ointments on the incision."
acdf,After Surgery,Will I have to wear a neck brace?,- Do I need a cervical collar after surgery? <br>- For how long do I have to wear the brace?,"That depends on your specific surgery. If you had a fusion at multiple levels, you will likely wear a neck collar for about six to eight weeks to provide support while you heal. If you only had a single-level fusion, a collar is often not necessary. If you do need one, you can take it off for showering and eating, but you should wear it at all other times, especially when sleeping or riding in a car."
acdf,After Surgery,What are my activity restrictions after I go home?,- What am I allowed to do after surgery? <br>- How long until I can go back to my normal activities?,"For the first few weeks, you should avoid lifting anything heavier than about 10-15 pounds. There should be no repetitive bending or twisting of your neck. Walking is the best exercise you can doâstart with short, frequent walks and gradually increase your distance. You should not drive while you are taking narcotic pain medication. Most people can return to full, unrestricted activities after about 8 to 12 weeks."
acdf,Medications,Are there any medications I should avoid after surgery?,- Can I take Advil or Aleve for pain? <br>- Which pain relievers are not allowed after a fusion?,"This is extremely important: you must avoid all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. This includes common over-the-counter medications like Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and Naproxen (Aleve). These drugs can stop the bones from healing and fusing together. You should not take them for at least 3 months after surgery. We will give you a prescription for pain medication that is safe to use. Tylenol is also okay."
acdf,Follow-Up,When should I call the doctor's office?,- What are the warning signs I should look out for? <br>- What symptoms are considered an emergency?,"You should call us if you develop a fever over 101Â°F, if your incision becomes more red, swollen, or starts to drain, or if you experience worsening numbness or weakness in your arms or legs. If you have any trouble breathing or significant swelling in your neck, you should call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room immediately, as this is an emergency."
acdf,Foundational,What is an Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF)?,What does ACDF stand for?; Can you explain my neck surgery?,"An ACDF is a surgery performed through the front (""Anterior"") of your neck to relieve pressure on your spinal cord or nerves. We remove the damaged disc (""Discectomy"") and then encourage the two vertebrae to grow together into one solid bone (""Fusion""), which stabilizes the spine."
acdf,Foundational,Why do I need to have this surgery?,What condition does ACDF treat?; Why was this recommended for me?,"You are likely having this surgery because a disc or bone spur in your neck is compressing your spinal nerves or spinal cord. This pressure can cause neck/arm pain, numbness or tingling in your fingers (radiculopathy), or even issues with balance and coordination (myelopathy). The goal is to remove that pressure."
acdf,Pre-Op Prep,What medications do I need to stop before my ACDF?,Do I stop taking Advil?; What about blood thinners?,"This is critical for a fusion. You must stop all NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, Naproxen, Aleve) at least 7 days before surgery. You must also get clearance from your prescribing doctor to stop any blood thinners. Tylenol is safe to continue."
acdf,Pre-Op Prep,Are there eating or drinking restrictions before surgery?,When do I need to be NPO?; Can I have water?,"Yes. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes water, coffee, and chewing gum. You may take approved morning medications with a small sip of water."
acdf,The Cervical Collar,Will I have to wear a neck brace after surgery?,Do I get a collar?; What is the brace for?,"Yes, most patients will wake up in a cervical collar. This brace is not to help your neck heal, but rather to serve as a constant reminder to limit your neck motion and to protect the surgical site as the fusion begins."
acdf,The Cervical Collar,How long do I have to wear the collar?,When can I take the brace off?; Do I wear it 24/7?,"You should wear the collar at all times, including while sleeping, unless otherwise instructed. You may typically remove it for short periods to shower and clean the collar itself, starting 48 hours after surgery. Most patients wear the collar for 2 to 6 weeks."
acdf,Swallowing & Voice,Is it normal to have a sore throat or a hoarse voice?,Why is it hard to swallow?; Will my voice come back?,"Yes, this is very common and expected. The instruments used during surgery can irritate the nerves to your voice box and esophagus. Your throat will likely be sore, your voice may be hoarse, and you may feel a ""lump"" when you swallow. This almost always improves over several days to weeks."
acdf,Swallowing & Voice,What should I eat if it's hard to swallow?,What is the best diet after ACDF?; Are there foods to avoid?,"Start with a soft diet. Things like smoothies, yogurt, pudding, mashed potatoes, and soups are excellent choices. Avoid dry, crumbly, or tough foods like bread, crackers, and steak for the first few days, as they can be difficult to swallow."
acdf,Incision Care,How do I care for the incision on my neck?,When can I shower?; What do I do about the glue or steri-strips?,You may shower 48 hours after surgery. Let soapy water run over the incision but do not scrub it. Pat it dry gently. Your incision is sealed with surgical glue or steri-strips; do not peel them off. They will fall off on their own in 10-14 days.
acdf,Activity,How much can I lift after my ACDF?,What are my lifting restrictions?; Can I pick up my child?,"For the first 4-6 weeks, you should not lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk (about 8-10 pounds). This is to avoid straining your neck muscles and to protect the new fusion."
acdf,Activity,What other movements should I avoid?,Can I bend my neck?; Is it okay to twist my head?,You must avoid excessive or repetitive bending and twisting of your neck. Let the collar remind you. Avoid looking up at the ceiling or down at your shoes for long periods. Try to turn your whole body instead of just your neck.
acdf,Activity,When am I allowed to drive?,When is it safe to operate a car?,"You cannot drive as long as you are taking narcotic pain medication. You must also be able to turn your head comfortably enough to check blind spots and react in an emergency. For most, this is at least 2-4 weeks after surgery."
acdf,Sleeping,What is the best way to sleep after surgery?,How do I sleep with the collar on?; Can I sleep on my side?,Sleeping in a recliner or propped up in bed with several pillows is often most comfortable for the first week or two. It is safe to sleep on your back or your side. You must wear your collar while sleeping to prevent your neck from getting into an awkward position.
acdf,Medications,Which medications MUST I avoid after surgery?,Can I take Ibuprofen for pain?; Are NSAIDs okay after a fusion?,"This is extremely important: you must avoid all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for at least 3 months after surgery. This includes Advil, Motrin, Ibuprofen, Naproxen, and Aleve. These drugs can stop the bones from healing and fusing together."
acdf,Warning Signs,What symptoms require an urgent call to the office?,What are the red flags?; When should I be worried?,"Please call our office if you develop a fever over 101.5Â°F, if your incision becomes more red, swollen, or starts to drain pus, or if you experience new or worsening numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs."
acdf,Warning Signs,What symptoms are considered an emergency?,When should I call 911?; What if I can't breathe?,"If you experience significant, sudden swelling in your neck or have any difficulty breathing or catching your breath, this is an emergency. You should call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room immediately."
acdf,About the Hardware,What is the plate and screws you use made of?,Will I have metal in my neck?; What kind of hardware is it?,"We use a very small, low-profile plate and screws made of medical-grade titanium. This material is extremely strong, lightweight, and highly compatible with the body, meaning it very rarely causes any issues."
acdf,About the Hardware,Will the hardware set off metal detectors at the airport?,Do I need a doctor's note for TSA?; Will I have problems with security?,It's highly unlikely. Modern titanium hardware has a very low magnetic signature and is generally not detected by airport security scanners. You will not need a special card or note for travel.
acdf,About the Hardware,What do you use for the bone graft part of the fusion?,Where does the bone for the fusion come from?; Is it my own bone?,"For the fusion, we use a spacer that goes where the disc was, and this is filled with bone graft material to stimulate the vertebrae to grow together. We will discuss the specific type of graft material being used for your individual case before surgery."
acdf,Surgery & Hospital,How long does the ACDF operation usually take?,How long will I be in surgery?; What is the OR time?,"While every case is unique, a one or two-level ACDF surgery itself typically takes about 1 to 2 hours. You should plan on being in the operating room and recovery area for several hours total."
acdf,Surgery & Hospital,How long will I be in the hospital after surgery?,Is this an overnight stay?; When do I get to go home?,Most patients who have a one or two-level ACDF go home the same day or after a single overnight stay in the hospital. Our goal is to make sure your pain is controlled and you are able to walk safely before you are discharged.
acdf,Surgery & Hospital,Will I have a drain in my neck after surgery?,What is this tube coming out of my incision?; When does the drain come out?,"It is common to have a small, temporary surgical drain placed in the incision. This is done to prevent fluid from collecting under the skin. If you have one, it is typically removed before you leave the hospital."
acdf,Pain & Recovery,How much pain will I be in when I wake up?,Is this a very painful surgery?; What should I expect for pain control?,"You should expect to have some pain, particularly a sore throat and soreness at the incision site. We have a comprehensive pain management plan to keep you comfortable, using a combination of medications in the hospital and prescriptions for you to take at home. The severe arm pain you had before surgery is often gone immediately."
acdf,Pain & Recovery,Will I be prescribed muscle relaxers?,What can I do for neck spasms?; Are muscle spasms normal?,"Yes, neck muscle spasms are very common after this surgery as the muscles get used to the new alignment. We will typically provide a prescription for a muscle relaxer to help manage these spasms, especially for the first couple of weeks."
acdf,Recovery at Home,Will I need someone to help me at home?,Can I be alone after surgery?; What kind of help will I need?,"We strongly recommend having a friend or family member stay with you for at least the first 24-48 hours after you get home. They can help with meals, reminders for medication, and provide general support as you recover."
acdf,Recovery at Home,Is it safe for me to go up and down stairs?,Can I sleep in my upstairs bedroom?; Are stairs okay?,"Yes, you can use stairs. The key is to take them slowly and carefully. Always use the handrail for support and try to look straight ahead, rather than down at your feet, to avoid bending your neck."
acdf,Recovery at Home,What about my pets? Can I take care of my dog or cat?,Can I walk my dog?; Is it okay to bend over to feed my cat?,"You must be very careful with pets. You cannot bend your neck down to fill food or water bowls, so place them on a raised surface. You absolutely cannot walk a dog on a leash for the first 4-6 weeks, as a sudden pull could seriously injure your neck."
acdf,Long-Term Outlook,Will I lose a lot of motion in my neck forever?,How much will I be able to move my neck after it heals?; Will my neck feel stiff?,"This is a very common concern. For a one or two-level fusion, most patients notice very little, if any, change in their overall range of neck motion. The majority of your neck's rotation comes from the very top of your spine, which we are not operating on."
acdf,Long-Term Outlook,How long does it take for the fusion to be solid?,When is the bone fully healed?; What is the fusion success rate?,"A fusion is a slow process. While you will feel much better within weeks, it takes at least 3 to 6 months for the bone to become solid, and it can continue to mature for up to a year. We will track your healing with x-rays. The success rate for achieving a solid fusion is very high, typically well over 90%."
acdf,Long-Term Outlook,When can I start exercising again?,When can I go back to the gym?; What kind of exercise is safe?,"We want you walking immediately, as it's the best exercise for recovery. You can typically resume low-impact cardio, like using a stationary bike or elliptical, around 4-6 weeks. We will clear you for more strenuous activities and a return to the gym once we see evidence of a solid fusion on your x-rays."
acdf,Follow-Up,How often will I need to get x-rays after the surgery?,Will you be checking the fusion?; What are the follow-up appointments for?,"We will get an x-ray at most of your post-operative visits, typically around 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and beyond. These images are essential for us to monitor the hardware and confirm that the bones are fusing together properly."
acdf,Activity,What other movements should I avoid?,Can I bend my neck?; Is it okay to twist my head?,You must avoid excessive or repetitive bending and twisting of your neck. Let the collar remind you. Avoid looking up at the ceiling or down at your shoes for long periods. Try to turn your whole body instead of just your neck.

They can help with meals, reminders for medication, and provide general support as you recover."
acdf,Recovery at Home,Is it safe for me to go up and down stairs?,Can I sleep in my upstairs bedroom?; Are stairs okay?,"Yes, you can use stairs. The key is to take them slowly and carefully. Always use the handrail for support and try to look straight ahead, rather than down at your feet, to avoid bending your neck."
acdf,Recovery at Home,What about my pets? Can I take care of my dog or cat?,Can I walk my dog?; Is it okay to bend over to feed my cat?,"You must be very careful with pets. You cannot bend your neck down to fill food or water bowls, so place them on a raised surface. You absolutely cannot walk a dog on a leash for the first 4-6 weeks, as a sudden pull could seriously injure your neck."
acdf,Long-Term Outlook,Will I lose a lot of motion in my neck forever?,How much will I be able to move my neck after it heals?; Will my neck feel stiff?,"This is a very common concern. For a one or two-level fusion, most patients notice very little, if any, change in their overall range of neck motion. The majority of your neck's rotation comes from the very top of your spine, which we are not operating on."
acdf,Long-Term Outlook,How long does it take for the fusion to be solid?,When is the bone fully healed?; What is the fusion success rate?,"A fusion is a slow process. While you will feel much better within weeks, it takes at least 3 to 6 months for the bone to become solid, and it can continue to mature for up to a year. We will track your healing with x-rays. The success rate for achieving a solid fusion is very high, typically well over 90%."
acdf,Long-Term Outlook,When can I start exercising again?,When can I go back to the gym?; What kind of exercise is safe?,"We want you walking immediately, as it's the best exercise for recovery. You can typically resume low-impact cardio, like using a stationary bike or elliptical, around 4-6 weeks. We will clear you for more strenuous activities and a return to the gym once we see evidence of a solid fusion on your x-rays."
acdf,Follow-Up,How often will I need to get x-rays after the surgery?,Will you be checking the fusion?; What are the follow-up appointments for?,"We will get an x-ray at most of your post-operative visits, typically around 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and beyond. These images are essential for us to monitor the hardware and confirm that the bones are fusing together properly."
acdf,About the Procedure,Will I be able to feel the plate and screws in my neck?,- Is the hardware noticeable? <br>- Can you feel the metal plate under the skin? <br>- Will the plate set off metal detectors?,"No, you will not be able to feel the plate and screws. They are very low-profile and are placed deep beneath your muscles. They will not set off metal detectors at the airport."
acdf,About the Procedure,Will my neck be stiff forever?,- How much motion will I lose in my neck? <br>- Will I still be able to turn my head? <br>- Does a fusion mean my neck won't move?,"This is a very common concern. For a one or two-level fusion, most patients notice very little, if any, change in their overall range of neck motion. The majority of your neck's rotation comes from the very top of your spine, which we are not operating on."
acdf,About the Procedure,What is the plate made of?,- What kind of metal is used in the hardware? <br>- Is the plate titanium? <br>- Can I have an allergic reaction to the metal?,"The plate and screws are made of medical-grade titanium alloy. This material is extremely biocompatible, and allergic reactions are incredibly rare. It is very strong and safe for use inside the body."
acdf,About the Procedure,Does this surgery put stress on the other discs?,- Will I have problems with other levels later? <br>- Does fusing one level cause issues above or below? <br>- What is adjacent segment disease?,"Fusing a level can place slightly more stress on the discs above and below the fusion. While many people never have a problem, it is possible that this can accelerate the wear and tear on those adjacent discs over time, which might require treatment in the future."
acdf,The Surgery,How long does an ACDF surgery take?,- How many hours is the ACDF operation? <br>- What is the surgical time? <br>- How long will I be in the operating room?,"The surgery for a single-level ACDF usually takes about 60 to 90 minutes. If more than one level is being fused, it will take a bit longer."
acdf,The Surgery,What is neuromonitoring?,- How do you monitor my spinal cord? <br>- What is that procedure that keeps my nerves safe? <br>- Can you explain the nerve monitoring?,Neuromonitoring is a safety measure we use during surgery. A specialist monitors the function of your spinal cord and nerves in real-time while you are asleep. This gives us immediate feedback and helps us protect your spinal cord from injury throughout the entire procedure.
acdf,The Surgery,Will I have a drain in my neck?,- What is the tube coming out of my incision? <br>- Why is there a drain? <br>- How long does the drain stay in?,"Yes, it's common to have a small, temporary drain placed next to the incision. This helps remove any excess fluid that can collect after surgery, which reduces swelling and pressure. The drain is usually removed by your nurse the morning after surgery, before you go home."
acdf,Risks & Complications,What are the chances my voice will be hoarse?,- Is it common to have a raspy voice? <br>- Could the surgery permanently affect my voice? <br>- Why does my throat feel funny?,A temporary hoarseness or a raspy voice is quite common after ACDF. This happens because the nerve that controls your vocal cords is very close to the surgical area and can get stretched or irritated. This almost always resolves within a few days or weeks. Permanent voice change is very rare.
acdf,Risks & Complications,Is it possible the bones won't fuse?,"- What happens if the fusion doesn't take? <br>- What is a ""non-union""? <br>- How likely is it that the bones don't heal together?","A ""non-union,"" where the bones fail to fuse, is a possible but uncommon complication. The risk is much higher for people who smoke. If a non-union does occur and causes symptoms, another surgery may be needed to get the bones to heal properly."
acdf,Risks & Complications,Could the plate or screws come loose?,- Can the hardware break or move? <br>- What is the risk of hardware failure? <br>- Is the plate secure?,"The hardware we use is extremely strong and secure. The risk of a screw or plate breaking or moving is very low, especially when you follow your post-operative activity restrictions. We will check the hardware with x-rays at your follow-up visits."
acdf,After Surgery,How long will I have to stay in the hospital?,- Is ACDF an outpatient surgery? <br>- Will I go home the same day? <br>- What is the typical hospital stay?,"Most patients stay in the hospital for one night for observation after an ACDF. This allows us to monitor your swallowing, manage your pain, and make sure you're safe to go home. Some patients undergoing a single-level fusion may be able to go home the same day."
acdf,After Surgery,What kind of food should I eat when I get home?,- What is a good diet after neck surgery? <br>- Are there foods that are easier to swallow? <br>- Do I need to be on a special diet?,"Because you will have a sore throat, it's best to stick to soft foods for the first few days. Things like soups, yogurt, mashed potatoes, smoothies, and ice cream are good choices. Avoid dry or tough foods like bread and steak. It's important to stay hydrated."
acdf,After Surgery,When can I wash my hair?,- Is it okay to raise my arms above my head? <br>- How can I wash my hair if I can't bend my neck? <br>- Are there restrictions on showering?,"You can shower the day after surgery and it is okay to raise your arms to wash your hair. Try to keep your neck in a neutral position and avoid looking up or down too much. If you have a collar, you can remove it to shower."
acdf,After Surgery,Will I have pain between my shoulder blades?,- Why does my upper back hurt after neck surgery? <br>- Is shoulder blade pain normal? <br>- What causes the pain between the shoulders?,"Yes, it is very common to experience some aching pain between your shoulder blades. When we restore the normal disc height, it can stretch the muscles and ligaments in your neck and upper back. This is a normal part of the healing process and should improve over a few weeks or months."
acdf,After Surgery,When can I look up and down?,- How much can I move my neck? <br>- Are there limits on my neck motion? <br>- Can I turn my head side to side?,"For the first few weeks, you should avoid extreme neck movements. Try to keep your neck in a neutral, straight position as much as possible. You can turn your head gently to look side to side, but avoid looking all the way up or bending your chin all the way to your chest."
acdf,Pain Management,Will I have muscle spasms in my neck and shoulders?,- Is it normal for my neck to feel tight? <br>- What can I do for muscle spasms? <br>- Why are my shoulder muscles so sore?,"Yes, muscle spasms in the neck and shoulders are very common after this surgery. The muscles are reacting to the procedure. We will give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with this, and applying an ice pack can also provide relief."
acdf,Pain Management,Is it better to use ice or heat?,"- Should I put ice on my neck? <br>- Can I use a heating pad? <br>- What's better for the pain, heat or cold?","For the first few days, ice is best. It will help reduce swelling and numb the area, which eases pain and muscle spasms. You can apply an ice pack to the back of your neck or shoulders for 15-20 minutes at a time. After the first week, you can use whichever feels better."
acdf,Pain Management,Will I still have numbness or tingling in my hands?,- Why are my fingers still numb? <br>- How long does it take for the numbness to go away? <br>- Will the tingling ever stop?,"It's very common for numbness and tingling to take longer to resolve than pain. Nerves heal very slowly, and it can take several weeks or even months for these sensations to fully disappear. Be patient with the healing process."
acdf,Activity & Recovery,What are the rules for wearing the neck collar?,- When can I take the brace off? <br>- Do I have to sleep in the collar? <br>- Can I drive with the brace on?,"If you are given a collar, you must wear it at all times, including while sleeping. You can take it off for short periods to shower or shave. You should not drive while wearing the collar as it restricts your ability to turn your head."
acdf,Activity & Recovery,How do I clean my neck brace?,- Can I wash the collar? <br>- What are the instructions for cleaning the brace? <br>- How do I keep the collar from smelling?,You can wash the soft pads of the collar by hand with mild soap and water and let them air dry. You can wipe the hard plastic parts clean with a damp cloth. It's a good idea to have two sets of pads so you can wear one while the other is drying.
acdf,Activity & Recovery,When can I travel?,- Can I ride in a car for a long trip? <br>- When is it safe to fly on a plane? <br>- Are there restrictions on travel?,"You can ride as a passenger in a car as soon as you feel up to it. For long trips, you should plan to stop every hour or so to get out and walk around. We generally recommend waiting at least 4-6 weeks before flying to reduce the risk of blood clots."
acdf,Activity & Recovery,What can I do to help my bones fuse faster?,- Is there anything I can do to improve my outcome? <br>- How can I ensure a successful fusion? <br>- What helps with bone healing?,The single most important thing you can do is to not smoke. Nicotine is the enemy of a successful fusion. Eating a healthy diet with enough protein and calcium is also helpful. Following your activity restrictions and walking regularly will also promote good blood flow and healing.
acdf,Long-Term Outlook,How long does it take for the fusion to be solid?,- When is the bone fully healed? <br>- What is the fusion success rate? <br>- How long until the fusion is complete?,"A fusion is a slow process. While you will feel much better within weeks, it takes at least 3 to 6 months for the bone to become solid, and it can continue to mature for up to a year. We will track your healing with x-rays. The success rate for achieving a solid fusion is very high, typically well over 90%."
acdf,Long-Term Outlook,Will I need to have this surgery again?,- Is this a permanent fix? <br>- Could I need another neck surgery in the future? <br>- How long does an ACDF last?,"For the level that is fused, it is a permanent fix. However, as we discussed, the levels above or below the fusion can wear out over time. While most people do not need another operation, it is a possibility years down the road."
acdf,Follow-Up,How often will I need to get x-rays after the surgery?,- Will you be checking the fusion? <br>- What are the follow-up appointments for? <br>- How do you monitor my healing?,"We will get an x-ray at most of your post-operative visits, typically around 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and beyond. These images are essential for us to monitor the hardware and confirm that the bones are fusing together properly."
spinal deformity,Scope of Surgery,Why is my surgery so much more complex than a standard fusion?,"- What makes a deformity correction a bigger operation? <br>- Is scoliosis surgery considered major surgery? <br>- How is this different from a one or two-level fusion? <br>- Why do you have to fuse so many levels of my spine? <br>- What does it mean to have a ""complex"" spine surgery?","Your surgery is more complex because our goal is not just to stabilize a single painful segment, but to correct the overall alignment and curvature of your spine, such as with scoliosis. This often involves fusing multiple vertebrae, using more instrumentation like rods and screws, and sometimes making precise cuts in the bone, called osteotomies, to realign the spine. It's a much larger-scale procedure aimed at restoring your overall balance."
spinal deformity,Scope of Surgery,What are the main goals of correcting my spinal deformity?,- What are you trying to achieve with this surgery? <br>- Will this surgery make me stand up straighter? <br>- Is the purpose to stop my curve from getting worse? <br>- How will this operation help my pain and breathing? <br>- What is the desired outcome of this procedure?,"We have three primary goals. First, to stop the progression of your curve. Second, to correct the deformity as much as is safely possible to improve your posture and balance. And third, to relieve pressure on your nerves and internal organs, which can reduce pain and, in some cases, improve lung function."
spinal deformity,Scope of Surgery,How long will this surgery take?,- How many hours will I be in the operating room? <br>- What is the estimated duration for a deformity correction? <br>- Is this an all-day surgery? <br>- Why does the surgery take so long? <br>- What is the typical surgical time for scoliosis?,"This is a long and meticulous operation. Depending on the complexity of your curve and the number of levels we need to fuse, the surgery can take anywhere from four to eight hours, or sometimes longer. We take all the time necessary to perform the correction safely and effectively."
spinal deformity,Scope of Surgery,What is an osteotomy?,"- You mentioned cutting the bone, what is that for? <br>- Why do you need to perform an osteotomy? <br>- Is an osteotomy a common part of this surgery? <br>- Can you explain what an osteotomy is? <br>- What does it mean to have a spinal osteotomy?","An osteotomy is a procedure where we make a precise surgical cut into a vertebra. In cases of a rigid spinal deformity, this allows us to ""loosen"" the spine, which gives us the ability to realign it into a much better position before we lock it in place with the rods and screws."
spinal deformity,Scope of Surgery,Will I be taller after the surgery?,- How much height will I gain from scoliosis surgery? <br>- Will correcting the curve make me taller? <br>- Can I expect to be taller after the operation? <br>- Does the surgery increase your height? <br>- Is gaining height a benefit of the surgery?,"Yes, most patients do gain some height after a deformity correction. By straightening the curve in your spine, we are restoring your natural trunk height. The amount gained depends on the severity of your curve, but gaining one to two inches is common."
spinal deformity,Risks & Complications,Will I need a blood transfusion?,- Is it common to need blood during this surgery? <br>- How much blood is typically lost? <br>- What are the chances I'll need a transfusion? <br>- Have you made arrangements for me to receive blood? <br>- Is blood loss a major concern?,"Due to the length of the surgery and the number of spinal levels involved, blood loss is expected, and it is often necessary to give a blood transfusion either during or after the procedure. This is a normal part of this type of surgery, and we have the blood products ready for you to ensure your safety."
spinal deformity,Risks & Complications,What is the risk of paralysis with such a big surgery?,- Could I be paralyzed from a scoliosis correction? <br>- How do you protect my spinal cord when moving the spine? <br>- Is nerve damage or paralysis a common risk? <br>- What safety measures are in place to prevent paralysis? <br>- How do you ensure my spinal cord is safe?,"The risk of paralysis is the most serious risk, but fortunately, it is very rare. We use continuous, real-time spinal cord monitoring throughout the entire operation. This system acts as an early warning system, alerting us to any potential stress on the spinal cord so we can react immediately. Your safety is our absolute highest priority."
spinal deformity,Risks & Complications,"What is a ""major"" vs. ""minor"" risk?","- Can you explain the difference between the types of complications? <br>- What do you mean by a ""bump in the road""? <br>- Are the major risks common? <br>- What are some of the less serious complications? <br>- How do you categorize the risks?","We consider ""minor"" risks to be complications that can be easily treated and don't affect your final outcome, like a superficial infection or temporary nerve irritationâthey are a ""bump in the road."" ""Major"" risks, like a deep infection or paralysis, are those that could have a significant, long-term impact. Thankfully, these major complications are very rare."
spinal deformity,Risks & Complications,What is the risk that the rods or screws could break?,- Can the hardware fail? <br>- Is it possible for a rod to break in the future? <br>- What happens if a screw comes loose? <br>- How strong is the instrumentation? <br>- What is the rate of hardware failure?,"The titanium and cobalt-chrome hardware we use is incredibly strong. The most common reason for a rod to break is if the bones fail to fuse together (a ""pseudarthrosis""). The rod is acting like a paperclip being bent back and forth and can eventually break. This is why achieving a solid fusion is so critical, and why quitting smoking is mandatory."
spinal deformity,Hospital Stay,How long will I be in the hospital?,- What is the typical hospital stay for deformity surgery? <br>- When will I be able to go home? <br>- How many days will I be admitted? <br>- Is it a long hospital stay? <br>- What determines when I can be discharged?,"This is a major surgery that requires a longer hospital stay than a simple fusion. Most patients are in the hospital for three to seven days. Your discharge depends on how well your pain is controlled, your ability to walk with the physical therapist, and your overall medical stability."
spinal deformity,Hospital Stay,Is it true I might go to the ICU after surgery?,- Why would I need to go to the Intensive Care Unit? <br>- Is a stay in the ICU common after this surgery? <br>- What happens in the ICU? <br>- Will I wake up in the ICU? <br>- What is the purpose of the ICU stay?,"Yes, it is very common to spend one or two days in the ICU after this surgery. This allows for very close, one-on-one monitoring of your heart, lungs, and vital signs as you recover from a long anesthesia. In some cases, if the anesthesiologist feels it's safest, you may even remain on the breathing tube overnight in the ICU. It is a standard safety measure."
spinal deformity,Hospital Stay,Will I be in a lot of pain in the hospital?,- How will you control my pain after the surgery? <br>- What is a PCA or pain pump? <br>- Is the pain manageable after the operation? <br>- What should I expect for post-operative pain? <br>- How do you manage pain right after surgery?,"We expect you to have significant pain, and we have a robust plan to manage it. You will likely have a ""Patient-Controlled Analgesia"" or PCA pump. This allows you to push a button to give yourself a small, safe dose of IV pain medicine whenever you need it. We will also use oral medications to keep you as comfortable as possible."
spinal deformity,Hospital Stay,When will I be able to get out of bed?,- Will I be on bedrest after the surgery? <br>- How soon will I have to walk? <br>- When does physical therapy start? <br>- Will I be able to stand up the next day? <br>- How quickly do you get patients moving?,We will have you sit on the side of the bed and likely get you up to stand or sit in a chair on the very first day after your surgery. Physical therapy will begin right away in the hospital. Early mobilization is one of the most important keys to a successful recovery.
spinal deformity,Hospital Stay,Will I need to go to a rehab facility after the hospital?,- Can I go straight home from the hospital? <br>- What is an inpatient rehabilitation facility? <br>- Who decides if I need to go to rehab? <br>- Is it common to need rehab after this surgery? <br>- What is the plan if I can't go home right away?,"That is a possibility. The physical and occupational therapists will evaluate you in the hospital to determine if you can safely go home. If you need more intensive therapy before you are ready, we will arrange for you to go to an inpatient rehabilitation facility for a short time. The goal is to make sure you are safe and have the support you need."
spinal deformity,Recovery & Rehab,How long is the total recovery period?,- When will I feel completely back to normal? <br>- What is the full recovery timeline for scoliosis surgery? <br>- Is it a year-long recovery? <br>- How long does it take to heal from a deformity fusion? <br>- What does the recovery process look like?,"Full recovery from a deformity correction is a long process. You will feel stronger each week, but it typically takes six to nine months to feel significantly better and close to your baseline. However, the bone fusion will continue to mature and solidify for a full year or even longer. You must be patient with your body."
spinal deformity,Recovery & Rehab,Will I have to wear a back brace?,- Do I need a brace after surgery? <br>- For how long will I wear the brace? <br>- What are the rules for wearing the brace? <br>- Is the brace custom-molded? <br>- What is the purpose of the brace?,"Yes, you will be fitted with a custom back brace after your surgery. The brace provides additional support to your spine and helps the fusion heal. You will typically need to wear it for about three months whenever you are up and out of bed."
spinal deformity,Recovery & Rehab,"What does ""no BLT"" mean for me?","- What are the BLT restrictions after a big fusion? <br>- How strict is the ""no bending, lifting, or twisting"" rule? <br>- Can you give me examples of what I absolutely cannot do? <br>- How long do the BLT precautions last? <br>- What movements must I avoid to protect my fusion?","The ""no Bending, Lifting, or Twisting"" rule is the most important part of your recovery. It is not a suggestion; it is a strict requirement to protect the fusion. No bending at the waist, no lifting anything heavier than 10 pounds, and no twisting of your torso. You must follow this for at least three months, and often longer."
spinal deformity,Recovery & Rehab,Will I need a walker at home?,- For how long will I need to use a walker? <br>- Is a walker necessary for everyone? <br>- Will the hospital provide a walker? <br>- How do I use a walker correctly? <br>- Why is a walker important?,"Yes, you will be asked to use a walker for at least the first six weeks after your surgery. The walker provides stability, reduces the risk of a fall, and helps you maintain an upright posture while you are regaining your strength."
spinal deformity,Recovery & Rehab,When can I go back to school or work?,- How much time will I need to take off? <br>- What is the typical time off for this surgery? <br>- When can I return to a desk job? <br>- How long until I can do physical work? <br>- What is the return-to-work timeline?,"Returning to work or school depends on your progress and the nature of your activities. For a desk job or school, you can typically return in 6 to 12 weeks, often starting with half-days. Returning to a physically demanding job will take much longer, likely six months or more."
spinal deformity,Recovery & Rehab,Will I need help with daily activities like dressing?,"- Will I be able to take care of myself at home? <br>- What kind of help will I need with personal care? <br>- Will I need special equipment to get dressed? <br>- How will I put on my socks and shoes? <br>- What are ""adaptive equipment"" aids?","Yes, you will need help. Due to the ""no bending"" rule, simple tasks like putting on socks and shoes will be impossible at first. The occupational therapist will show you how to use long-handled tools like a reacher and a sock aid to help you be more independent, but you will need assistance."
spinal deformity,Life After Surgery,How long will my back incision be?,- Will I have a big scar down my back? <br>- How long is the cut for scoliosis surgery? <br>- What will the scar look like? <br>- Is the incision very noticeable? <br>- Where will the scar be located?,"You will have a long, vertical incision down the middle of your back. The length depends entirely on how many levels of your spine need to be fused. We will close it as carefully as possible, but a long scar is an unavoidable part of this surgery."
spinal deformity,Life After Surgery,Will I be able to have children in the future?,- Can I get pregnant after a spinal fusion? <br>- Does this surgery affect my ability to have a baby? <br>- Is it safe to have an epidural with a fusion? <br>- Will the hardware interfere with pregnancy? <br>- Does scoliosis surgery impact childbirth?,"Yes, absolutely. Having a spinal fusion does not prevent you from having a normal pregnancy and delivery in the future. You should always inform your obstetrician and anesthesiologist about your surgery, but it is very common and safe."
spinal deformity,Life After Surgery,Can I ever play sports again?,- Will I be able to return to my sport? <br>- What activities are safe after a long fusion? <br>- Are there any permanent restrictions? <br>- When can I resume athletic activities? <br>- Is it safe to play contact sports?,"After your fusion is completely solid, which can take up to a year, you can return to many activities. We generally recommend avoiding high-impact or collision sports like football or rugby permanently. However, activities like swimming, biking, and light jogging are usually fine. We will discuss your specific goals."
spinal deformity,Life After Surgery,Will I feel stiff for the rest of my life?,- How much flexibility will I lose permanently? <br>- Will I be able to bend and move normally eventually? <br>- Does a long fusion make your back feel stiff? <br>- What will my motion be like in the long run? <br>- Is the loss of motion significant?,"You will have a permanent loss of motion in the fused segments of your spine. However, your brain and body are remarkable at adapting. Most of the bending we do comes from our hips, and you will learn to use your unfused segments and hips more efficiently. Most patients adapt very well and do not feel overly restricted in their daily activities."
spinal deformity,Follow-Up,How do you know if the fusion is healing properly?,- How do you check the fusion? <br>- Will I need a CT scan after surgery? <br>- What do you look for on the x-rays? <br>- How can you tell if the bone is solid? <br>- What is the follow-up imaging schedule?,"We will monitor your fusion with a series of x-rays at your follow-up appointments. On these images, we can see the new bone forming and solidifying over time. If there is ever a question about the healing, we may order a CT scan, which gives us a much more detailed, 3D view of the fusion."
spinal deformity,Scope of Surgery,Will my back look normal after the surgery?,- Will my hump be gone? <br>- Will my shoulders be even? <br>- Can you make my back straight? <br>- How much correction can you get? <br>- Will I look different in clothes?,"The goal of the surgery is to significantly improve the curve and your overall alignment. While a perfect correction is not always possible, we aim to make your back appear much straighter and more balanced. Most patients are very pleased with the improvement in their posture and how their clothes fit afterward."
spinal deformity,Scope of Surgery,Why do you have to fuse so many bones?,- Why is my fusion so long? <br>- Can't you just fix the worst part of the curve? <br>- Why does the fusion have to go all the way up/down my back? <br>- How do you decide how many levels to fuse? <br>- Is it necessary to fuse such a large part of my spine?,"To properly balance your spine, we need to fuse the entire length of the curve. If we only fused a small part of it, the un-fused parts of the curve above and below could continue to progress, leading to problems in the future. Fusing the entire curve gives you the most stable, lasting result."
spinal deformity,Risks & Complications,What is the biggest risk I should worry about?,- What is the most serious thing that can go wrong? <br>- What is the worst-case scenario? <br>- Which complication is the most dangerous? <br>- What is the most significant risk of this surgery? <br>- What keeps you up at night as the surgeon?,"While all risks are taken seriously, the most significant potential complication is a neurologic deficit, which means injury to the spinal cord or nerves. I want to reassure you that this is extremely rare. We use advanced spinal cord monitoring throughout the entire surgery to protect you, and your safety is our absolute first priority."
spinal deformity,Risks & Complications,What happens if I get an infection?,- How do you treat an infection after surgery? <br>- Is an infection dangerous? <br>- What are the signs of an infection? <br>- How common are infections with this surgery? <br>- What if my wound gets infected?,"A deep wound infection is a serious complication. If it occurs, it often requires another surgery to wash out the wound, as well as a long course of IV antibiotics. We take extensive precautions to prevent this, including giving you antibiotics before, during, and after your surgery."
spinal deformity,Preparation,What can I do to be in the best shape for surgery?,"- How should I prepare my body for this operation? <br>- Is there any exercise I should be doing? <br>- How can I help make my recovery easier? <br>- What's the best way to get ready for surgery? <br>- What is ""pre-hab""?","The stronger and more fit you are before surgery, the better your recovery will be. The best things you can do are walking and deep breathing exercises. If you can, working with a physical therapist beforehand to optimize your condition can be very beneficial. And most importantly, you must not smoke."
spinal deformity,Preparation,Why do I need to see my regular doctor before surgery?,"- What is a ""medical clearance""? <br>- Why do I need to get cleared for surgery? <br>- What tests will my family doctor do? <br>- What if my doctor says I'm not healthy enough? <br>- Is it okay to have surgery with my other health problems?","This is a long and demanding surgery, so we need to make sure your body is ready for it. Your medical doctor will perform a thorough evaluation, including tests like an EKG and blood work, to ensure your heart, lungs, and overall health are optimized for a safe procedure and recovery."
spinal deformity,Preparation,How should I prepare my home for when I get back?,- What do I need to get for my house? <br>- How can I make my home safe for recovery? <br>- Do I need any special equipment? <br>- What should I do to get my house ready? <br>- Are there any home modifications I need?,"It's a great idea to prepare your home. Place frequently used items where you can reach them without bending. Remove throw rugs or cords you could trip over. You will need a chair with armrests, and you may want to install a hand-held shower head and a raised toilet seat."
spinal deformity,Hospital Stay,Will I wake up with a breathing tube in?,- Is it possible I'll still be on the ventilator after surgery? <br>- Why would I need to stay on a breathing machine? <br>- How long would the breathing tube stay in? <br>- Is it scary to wake up on a ventilator? <br>- What does it mean to be intubated?,"In some cases, after a very long surgery, the anesthesiologist may decide it's safest to leave the breathing tube in place overnight while you are in the ICU. This allows your body to rest and recover while the machine does the work of breathing for you. It is a standard safety measure and the tube is removed the next morning."
spinal deformity,Hospital Stay,"What is the ""log rolling"" I've heard about?",- How will the nurses move me in bed? <br>- Why do I have to turn like a log? <br>- Can I turn over by myself? <br>- What is the log roll technique? <br>- How do I move in bed without twisting?,"Log rolling is how we will turn you in bed to protect your fusion. The nurses will use a sheet to help turn your shoulders and hips at the same time, as a single unit, like a log. This prevents any twisting motion on your spine while it's healing."
spinal deformity,Hospital Stay,What is that plastic thing I have to breathe into?,- What is an incentive spirometer? <br>- Why do I have to do breathing exercises? <br>- How does that breathing machine work? <br>- What's the purpose of the breathing toy? <br>- Do I have to use the spirometer?,"That is an incentive spirometer, and it's one of the most important parts of your recovery in the hospital. Using it often helps you take deep breaths, which keeps your lungs open and clear after anesthesia. This is the best way to prevent complications like pneumonia."
spinal deformity,Hospital Stay,Will I be really swollen after the surgery?,- Is it normal to have a puffy face? <br>- Why do I look so swollen? <br>- How long will the swelling last? <br>- Is it from the IV fluids? <br>- Why is my whole body swollen?,"Yes, it is very common and normal to have significant swelling, especially in your face and body. This is caused by the large amount of IV fluids you receive during a long surgery and from being positioned on your stomach. The swelling will go away over the first few days."
spinal deformity,Recovery & Rehab,How do I clean my back brace?,- Can I wash the brace? <br>- What are the instructions for cleaning the brace? <br>- How do I keep my brace from getting smelly? <br>- Can I put the brace in the washing machine? <br>- What's the best way to care for my brace?,You can wipe the hard plastic parts of the brace with a damp cloth and mild soap. The soft liners can usually be hand-washed with gentle soap and water and should be left to air dry completely. It's a good idea to wear a thin t-shirt under your brace to keep it cleaner.
spinal deformity,Recovery & Rehab,"What does ""pain is a warning"" mean?",- How do I know if I'm doing too much? <br>- What if an activity hurts? <br>- Should I push through the pain? <br>- How do I listen to my body? <br>- What is a setback?,"It means you need to listen to your body. If you do an activity and have significantly increased pain for more than a couple of hours afterward, it's a sign that you've overdone it. Pain is your body's way of telling you to slow down and rest. Don't just take a pain pill and keep going."
spinal deformity,Recovery & Rehab,Will I need help taking a shower?,- Can I shower by myself? <br>- Will I need a shower chair? <br>- How do I wash my back? <br>- Is it safe to shower alone? <br>- What kind of help will I need in the bathroom?,"You will likely need some help with showering at first. You may feel weak or unsteady, so having someone nearby is important for safety. A shower chair and a long-handled sponge can be very helpful for washing your back and legs without bending or twisting."
spinal deformity,Recovery & Rehab,What is the most important exercise for me to do?,"- What is the best activity for my recovery? <br>- What kind of exercise should I be doing at home? <br>- Besides physical therapy, what should I do? <br>- Is there one exercise that is most important? <br>- What is the key to a good recovery?","Without a doubt, walking is the single most important exercise you can do. It helps your fusion heal, strengthens your muscles, helps your heart and lungs, and prevents blood clots. You should plan to walk several times a day, gradually increasing your distance as you feel stronger."
spinal deformity,Recovery & Rehab,How long will I need to take the strong pain medicine?,- When can I stop taking narcotics? <br>- How long will I be on the prescription pain pills? <br>- Will I be on pain medicine for months? <br>- When can I switch to Tylenol? <br>- How do I wean off the pain medication?,"You should expect to be on narcotic pain medication for several weeks after this surgery. The pain is significant, and it's important to stay ahead of it. We will work with you to create a plan to gradually decrease the narcotics as your pain improves and transition to over-the-counter options."
spinal deformity,Life After Surgery,Will my back feel weird with all that metal in it?,- Will I be able to feel the rods and screws? <br>- Does the hardware feel cold in the winter? <br>- Will my back feel heavy? <br>- Can you feel the implants under your skin? <br>- Does the metal cause any strange sensations?,"The rods and screws are placed deep under your strong back muscles, so you will not be able to feel them from the outside. The hardware is made of titanium and won't feel cold or heavy. Some patients report feeling more achy with weather changes, but most don't notice the implants at all."
spinal deformity,Life After Surgery,Will I be able to get an epidural for childbirth?,- Can I have an epidural if I have a fusion? <br>- Will the hardware get in the way of an epidural? <br>- Is it safe to get an epidural with rods in my back? <br>- Does the fusion affect pain control during labor? <br>- Should I tell the anesthesiologist about my surgery?,"Yes, in most cases, you can still have an epidural. It is very important to tell your obstetrician and the anesthesiologist about your surgery. They may need to use an ultrasound to guide the needle, but it is usually possible and safe to perform."
spinal deformity,Life After Surgery,Do I need to tell my dentist I have hardware in my back?,- Do I need to take antibiotics before dental work? <br>- Are there any special dental precautions? <br>- Does my dentist need to know about my surgery? <br>- Can I have my teeth cleaned after the fusion is healed? <br>- Are there any rules about going to the dentist?,"Yes, you should always inform your dentist about your spinal implants. Current guidelines do not typically require you to take antibiotics before a routine dental cleaning, but it is always best to make sure your dentist is aware of your surgical history."
spinal deformity,Life After Surgery,Will I be able to carry a backpack?,- Can I wear a backpack for school? <br>- Is it safe to carry a backpack after a fusion? <br>- How much weight can I carry in a backpack? <br>- Are there any special backpacks I should use? <br>- When can I start using a backpack again?,"Once your fusion is solid, usually after about a year, you can use a backpack. It is very important to use a good quality backpack with two padded shoulder straps and to wear it correctly over both shoulders. You should keep the weight in the backpack to a reasonable level, generally no more than 10-15% of your body weight."
spinal deformity,Follow-Up,What if my curve starts to get worse again?,"- Can the scoliosis come back after surgery? <br>- What is ""adding on""? <br>- Could I need another surgery in the future? <br>- What happens if the fusion stops at the wrong place? <br>- Is it possible for the curve to progress?","It is rare, but sometimes the spine can develop a new curve above or below the fused area. We call this ""adding on."" This is one of the reasons long-term follow-up is so important, so we can monitor your spine and catch any potential issues early."
spinal deformity,Follow-Up,How do you know if the screws are in the right place?,- Is it possible to put a screw in the wrong spot? <br>- How do you make sure the screws are safe? <br>- What protects my nerves from the screws? <br>- How accurate is the screw placement? <br>- What technology do you use to place the screws?,"We use advanced techniques like intra-operative CT scanning and computer navigation to place the screws with a very high degree of accuracy. This technology acts like a GPS for your spine, showing me the exact trajectory of the screw in real-time to ensure it is placed safely in the bone and away from your nerves."
spinal deformity,Follow-Up,"What is a ""bump in the road"" during recovery?",- What do you mean by a minor complication? <br>- Can you give me an example of a bump in the road? <br>- Are small problems common? <br>- How do you handle minor setbacks? <br>- What if I have a small issue during my recovery?,"A ""bump in the road"" is a minor, treatable problem that doesn't affect your final outcome. Examples might include a superficial wound issue that just needs dressing changes, temporary nerve irritation that gets better on its own, or a bladder infection that is easily treated with antibiotics."
spinal deformity,Follow-Up,What if I feel a pop or a crack in my back?,- Is it normal to feel things moving in my back? <br>- What should I do if I feel a pop? <br>- Can the hardware make noise? <br>- Is it bad if I feel a crack when I move? <br>- Should I be worried about popping sounds?,"It is common to feel occasional pops or clicks as you heal and start to move more. This is usually just scar tissue or the normal settling of your muscles and joints. However, if you feel a sudden, loud pop that is associated with a sharp increase in pain, you should call our office right away."
spinal deformity,Follow-Up,What is the most important thing I can do for a good result?,- What is the key to a successful surgery? <br>- What is my role in the recovery? <br>- How can I make sure I have the best outcome? <br>- What is the one thing I must do? <br>- What is the secret to a good recovery?,"The single most important thing you can do is to be an active and compliant partner in your own recovery. This means you absolutely must not smoke, you must follow the ""no bending, lifting, or twisting"" rules, and you must commit to your walking program. Your dedication is just as important as the surgery itself."
lumbar fusion,About the Procedure,What is the success rate for this surgery?,- How likely is it that this surgery will work for me? <br>- What are the chances this will fix my pain? <br>- How many of these surgeries are successful?,"The goal of a fusion is to stabilize the spine and reduce pain, and it has a very high success rate in achieving that. Success also depends on you. By following all of our post-operative instructions, especially the activity restrictions and not smoking, you give yourself the best possible chance for a great outcome."
lumbar fusion,About the Procedure,How is this different from a microdiscectomy?,"- I had a friend who had a microdiscectomy, is this the same? <br>- Why do I need a fusion instead of just removing the disc? <br>- Is a fusion a bigger surgery than a discectomy?","A microdiscectomy is a smaller surgery where we only remove the piece of disc that is pinching a nerve. A fusion is a more extensive procedure where we remove the entire disc and stabilize the bones to stop painful motion. We recommend a fusion when the problem is instability or significant disc collapse, not just a simple disc herniation."
lumbar fusion,About the Procedure,Will I be taller after the surgery?,- Does putting a cage in make you taller? <br>- Will my height change? <br>- How much height will I gain?,"When we remove the worn-out disc and replace it with a spacer or cage, we are restoring the disc to its normal, healthy height. Because of this, many patients do gain a small amount of height, perhaps a quarter to a half-inch, but it is not a primary goal of the surgery."
lumbar fusion,About the Procedure,Will I be able to feel the rods and screws?,- Can you feel the hardware under your skin? <br>- Is the metal noticeable from the outside? <br>- Will the implants bother me?,"No, the instrumentation is placed deep beneath the strong muscles of your back. You will not be able to feel the hardware, and it will not be visible from the outside."
lumbar fusion,About the Procedure,Will the hardware set off airport metal detectors?,- Do I need a doctor's note to fly? <br>- Will I have problems with TSA or security? <br>- Is the hardware magnetic?,The implants are made of medical-grade titanium alloy and are not magnetic. They typically do not set off modern airport metal detectors. It is not necessary to carry a special card or note with you when you travel.
lumbar fusion,About the Procedure,What happens if I don't have the surgery and just wait?,- What are the risks of not doing the surgery? <br>- Can my condition get worse if I wait? <br>- Is it dangerous to postpone the operation?,"If you have instability or nerve compression, waiting could allow the condition to worsen. This might lead to increased pain, progressive nerve damage, or more weakness in your legs. If non-surgical treatments have failed, surgery is the most reliable way to prevent further progression."
lumbar fusion,The Surgery,Why is a vascular surgeon involved in some cases?,- Will another surgeon be in the room? <br>- Who is the other doctor assisting you? <br>- What does the vascular surgeon do?,"For an anterior approach, where we enter from the front, we work with a vascular surgeon. They are experts at safely moving the large blood vessels in the abdomen aside so that I have a clear and direct path to the front of your spine. It's a team approach that makes the surgery safer."
lumbar fusion,The Surgery,Will I have more than one incision?,- How many cuts will I have? <br>- Why are there incisions on my back and side/front? <br>- Where will the scars be?,"The number and location of incisions depend on the specific approach we use. For some minimally invasive procedures, we may use two small incisions on your back. For an anterior or lateral approach, you will have an incision on your abdomen or side, and you may also have small incisions on your back if we need to place screws."
lumbar fusion,The Surgery,What is computer navigation?,"- How do you use a CT scan during surgery? <br>- What is the ""virtual reality"" technology you use? <br>- How do you make sure the screws are in the right place?","For some procedures, we use a special mobile CT scanner in the operating room. This gives us a real-time, 3D view of your spine. Using this image, computer navigation works like a GPS for your anatomy, allowing me to place the screws with exceptional accuracy and safety."
lumbar fusion,The Surgery,"How do you decide which approach (front, back, side) to use?",- Why did you choose this type of fusion for me? <br>- What determines the surgical approach? <br>- Is one approach better than another?,The decision is based entirely on your specific anatomy and the problem we need to fix. Each approach has unique advantages for accessing certain parts of the spine or placing larger implants. I have chosen the approach that will provide you with the safest and most effective result.
lumbar fusion,Risks & Complications,What is an ileus?,"- Why can't I eat right after surgery? <br>- What does ""temporary slowing of bowel function"" mean? <br>- Is it normal for my stomach not to work after surgery?","An ileus is a temporary and common condition where your bowels slow down after surgery, especially with an anterior (from the front) approach. It's a reaction to the anesthesia and the procedure. This is why we start you with ice chips and slowly advance your diet as your bowel function returns to normal."
lumbar fusion,Risks & Complications,What is the risk of a blood clot?,- How do you prevent blood clots in the legs? <br>- Am I at risk for a DVT or pulmonary embolism? <br>- What are the signs of a blood clot?,"A blood clot in the leg (DVT) is a risk with any major surgery. To prevent this, we will have you wear special compression stockings or devices on your legs in the hospital. The most important prevention is getting you up and walking as soon as possible after surgery to keep your blood circulating."
lumbar fusion,Risks & Complications,What happens if the cage or an implant moves?,- Can the hardware slip out of place? <br>- Is it possible for a screw to come loose? <br>- How stable are the implants?,"The implants we use are designed to lock securely into the bone. The risk of an implant moving or a screw coming loose is very low, especially when you follow the ""no bending, lifting, or twisting"" rule after surgery. We will check the position of all the hardware with x-rays at your follow-up visits."
lumbar fusion,Risks & Complications,What is the risk of sexual dysfunction?,- Can this surgery affect my sex life? <br>- Is it possible to have sexual problems after the operation? <br>- Why is sexual dysfunction listed as a risk?,"For the anterior (from the front) approach, there is a very small network of nerves near the spine that can affect ejaculation in men. Injury to these nerves is very rare, but we are obligated to inform you of the possibility. This is not a risk with posterior (from the back) or lateral (from the side) approaches."
lumbar fusion,Preparation,Why do I need to get my teeth cleaned before surgery?,- What does dental work have to do with back surgery? <br>- Can I go to the dentist after my surgery? <br>- Why is dental clearance required?,"Bacteria from your mouth can get into your bloodstream during a dental cleaning. We want to avoid any potential source of infection around your new implants, so we require you to have any dental work done before your fusion. You should not have any dental cleanings for six months after your surgery."
lumbar fusion,Preparation,What should I pack for the hospital?,- What do I need to bring with me? <br>- Is there a packing list for the hospital? <br>- What personal items should I have?,"You should bring personal toiletries like a toothbrush, toothpaste, and a comb. Pack loose-fitting, comfortable clothing with an elastic waistband for the trip home. Rubber-soled slippers or shoes are also a good idea. Please do not bring valuables or your home medications."
lumbar fusion,Preparation,How should I set up my house for recovery?,- What can I do to make my home safe for my return? <br>- Do I need any special equipment at home? <br>- How can I prepare my house before surgery?,It's a great idea to prepare your home. Place frequently used items on countertops so you don't have to bend down or reach up. Remove any loose rugs or cords that you could trip over. You may want to arrange for a raised toilet seat and have a stable chair to sit in.
lumbar fusion,After Surgery (Hospital Stay),Why am I so swollen after surgery?,- Is it normal to have swelling in my face and body? <br>- Why do I look so puffy? <br>- How long will the swelling last?,It is very common to have swelling after a long surgery. This is due to the large amount of IV fluids you receive to keep you hydrated and the fact that you are positioned on your stomach for several hours. The swelling is temporary and will resolve over the next few days.
lumbar fusion,After Surgery (Hospital Stay),What is that breathing machine I have to use?,- What is an incentive spirometer? <br>- Why do I have to do breathing exercises? <br>- How do I use the plastic breathing device?,"That is an incentive spirometer. It's a simple device that helps you take deep breaths. Using it frequently helps keep your lungs clear after anesthesia, preventing complications like pneumonia. It's one of the most important things you can do for your recovery in the hospital."
lumbar fusion,After Surgery (Hospital Stay),When can I eat a real meal?,- How long until I can eat solid food? <br>- Will I be on a liquid diet? <br>- When does my diet get advanced?,"We will advance your diet slowly. You will start with ice chips and sips of water. As your bowel function starts to return, we will advance you to clear liquids, and then to a regular diet. Most patients are eating a regular meal by the second or third day."
lumbar fusion,Pain Management,Will I have a pain pump?,- What is a PCA? <br>- Can I control my own pain medication? <br>- How will you manage my pain in the hospital?,"In the hospital, we will manage your pain with a combination of IV and oral medications. Sometimes, a Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump is used, which allows you to give yourself a small, safe dose of IV pain medicine when you push a button. Our goal is to keep you as comfortable as possible."
lumbar fusion,About the Procedure,"What does ""minimally invasive"" actually mean?",- How is this different from regular open surgery? <br>- Does minimally invasive mean smaller scars? <br>- Is this less painful than the old way of doing it? <br>- What are the benefits of a minimally invasive approach? <br>- How do you do the surgery through a small cut?,"Minimally invasive means we can perform the surgery through smaller incisions by gently separating the muscles instead of cutting through them. This approach often leads to less pain after surgery, a shorter hospital stay, and a faster overall recovery compared to traditional open surgery."
lumbar fusion,About the Procedure,"What is a ""cage"" that you put in my spine?",- What is the spacer you use made of? <br>- Why do you put a cage between the bones? <br>- Is the cage made of metal or plastic? <br>- What does the cage do? <br>- Is the cage permanent?,"The ""cage"" is a medical-grade spacer that we place into the empty disc space after we've removed the damaged disc. It's designed to hold the vertebrae at their proper height and is filled with bone graft material to help the bones fuse together. It becomes a permanent part of your spine's structure."
lumbar fusion,The Surgery,Why do you sometimes go through the stomach or side instead of the back?,- What are the advantages of going through the front? <br>- Is it better to have the surgery from the side? <br>- Why not just make the cut on my back? <br>- What determines which way you do the surgery? <br>- Is an ALIF or LLIF better than a TLIF?,"Approaching the spine from the front (anterior) or side (lateral) allows us to use a much larger cage, or spacer, which creates a more stable environment for the bones to fuse. It also avoids disrupting the large, important muscles in the back, which can lead to a quicker recovery. I choose the safest and most effective approach based on your specific anatomy."
lumbar fusion,The Surgery,What is BMP and is it safe?,- Can you tell me more about the bone protein? <br>- Is using a genetically engineered protein risky? <br>- Why do you use BMP instead of my own bone? <br>- What are the side effects of BMP? <br>- Is BMP approved for this surgery?,"BMP, or Bone Morphogenetic Protein, is a powerful, genetically engineered protein that stimulates your body to grow its own bone, which helps create a more reliable fusion. It is very safe and effective, and it avoids the need for a separate incision to harvest bone from your pelvis, which can be quite painful."
lumbar fusion,The Surgery,Will I have any tubes in me when I wake up?,- What is the tube in my bladder for? <br>- Will I have a catheter? <br>- Why do I have drains coming out of my back/side? <br>- Will I have an IV? <br>- How long do the tubes stay in?,"Yes, when you wake up, you will have a few tubes. You'll have an IV in your arm for fluids and medication, a small tube in your bladder called a Foley catheter to drain urine, and possibly a drain near your incision to collect excess fluid. These are all temporary and are usually removed within a day or two."
lumbar fusion,Risks & Complications,Why do my legs feel weak or numb right after the surgery?,- Is it normal for my leg to feel funny after surgery? <br>- Did the surgery make my nerve pain worse? <br>- Why is my foot numb now? <br>- How long will this weird feeling in my leg last? <br>- Is temporary nerve irritation common?,"It is quite common to have some temporary numbness, tingling, or even weakness in your legs after surgery. This can happen from the positioning during the procedure or from the nerves being manipulated as we relieve the pressure on them. These sensations almost always resolve over the next few weeks as the inflammation goes down."
lumbar fusion,Risks & Complications,What is the risk of the hardware breaking?,- Can the rods or screws break later on? <br>- What happens if a screw comes loose? <br>- How strong is the metal you put in? <br>- Is hardware failure common? <br>- What would cause a rod to break?,"The titanium hardware we use is extremely strong. The biggest risk for a rod breaking is if the bones fail to fuse together (a ""non-union""). In that case, the rod is acting like a paperclip being bent back and forth and can eventually break. This is why achieving a solid fusion is so critical, and why you must not smoke."
lumbar fusion,Preparation,What happens if I get a cold or sick right before my surgery?,- Should I call you if I get sick? <br>- Can you do the surgery if I have a fever? <br>- What if I get the flu before my operation date? <br>- Is it safe to have anesthesia if I'm sick? <br>- Will my surgery be canceled if I have a cough?,"You must call our office immediately if you develop any signs of illness, such as a fever, cough, or sore throat. It is not safe to have general anesthesia when you are sick. In most cases, we would need to postpone your surgery until you are fully recovered to ensure your safety."
lumbar fusion,Preparation,Why do I have to do a bowel prep for some fusions?,- Why do I need to clean out my bowels? <br>- Is the bowel prep like a colonoscopy prep? <br>- What is the purpose of the bowel prep? <br>- Does everyone have to do this? <br>- How do I do the bowel prep?,"For surgeries where we approach from the front (anterior), we need your intestines to be as empty as possible so the vascular surgeon can safely move them aside to give me a clear view of your spine. It is a critical safety step for that specific surgical approach."
lumbar fusion,Hospital Stay,When can my family visit me after the surgery?,- What are the visiting hours? <br>- Can my family be with me in the recovery room? <br>- How long until my family can see me? <br>- Will my family get updates during the surgery? <br>- When can I have visitors?,"Your family will not be able to see you in the main recovery room, but they can visit once you are settled in your hospital room. I will call them as soon as the procedure is finished to let them know how everything went."
lumbar fusion,Hospital Stay,What if I have to go to the bathroom in the hospital?,- How do I use the bathroom if I can't get up? <br>- Will I have a bedpan? <br>- How does the catheter work? <br>- What if I can't get to the toilet? <br>- How will I go to the bathroom?,"For the first day or so, you will have a Foley catheter in your bladder, so you won't have to worry about urinating. The nurses will assist you with a bedpan for bowel movements until you are strong enough to get up and walk to the bathroom with the help of a physical therapist or nurse."
lumbar fusion,After Surgery,What should I do if I get constipated from the pain medicine?,- Is it normal to get backed up from the pain pills? <br>- What can I take for constipation? <br>- How can I prevent constipation? <br>- What if I haven't had a bowel movement in days? <br>- Are the pain meds going to cause constipation?,"Yes, constipation is a very common side effect of narcotic pain medication. It is essential that you take an over-the-counter stool softener every day that you are taking the narcotic. Drinking plenty of water and walking are also very important to keep your bowels moving."
lumbar fusion,After Surgery,Why do I feel so tired all the time?,- Is it normal to be exhausted after this surgery? <br>- How long will I feel this tired? <br>- Why do I have no energy? <br>- When will my energy level come back? <br>- Is fatigue a normal part of recovery?,"It is completely normal to feel weak and tired for several weeks after a major surgery like this. Your body is using a tremendous amount of energy to heal. Be patient with yourself, get plenty of rest, and your energy will gradually return as you recover."
lumbar fusion,After Surgery,Will I have muscle spasms in my back?,- Is it normal for my back muscles to jump or cramp? <br>- What can I do for muscle spasms? <br>- Why are my back muscles so tight? <br>- How long will the muscle spasms last? <br>- Will you give me medicine for spasms?,"Yes, muscle spasms are very common after back surgery. The muscles are reacting to the procedure. We will give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant medication to help with this, and it will get better as you heal."
lumbar fusion,Activity & Recovery,Can I take care of my pets when I get home?,- Will I be able to walk my dog? <br>- Can I bend over to feed my cat? <br>- Is it okay to pick up my small dog? <br>- What are the rules about pets after surgery? <br>- How do I manage my pets during recovery?,"You will need help with your pets. You cannot walk a dog on a leash because they could pull and cause you to twist or fall. You cannot bend over to fill food and water bowls, and you cannot lift any pet, even a small one, that weighs more than 10 pounds."
lumbar fusion,Activity & Recovery,What if I live alone?,- Can I recover from this surgery by myself? <br>- Is it safe to go home if I live alone? <br>- What kind of help will I need if I don't have family nearby? <br>- Can I hire a caregiver? <br>- What happens if I have no one to help me at home?,"It is not safe to go home alone right after this surgery. You will need significant help for at least the first two weeks. If you do not have family or friends who can stay with you, we will arrange for you to go to a short-term inpatient rehabilitation facility to ensure you have the care and support you need to recover safely."
lumbar fusion,Activity & Recovery,How do I use the toilet if I can't bend?,- Will I need a special toilet seat? <br>- How do I sit down on the toilet? <br>- Is it hard to use the bathroom after surgery? <br>- What is a raised toilet seat? <br>- Can I use a regular toilet?,Standard toilets can be too low and difficult to use. We often recommend getting a raised toilet seat or toilet rails for your home. This makes it much easier and safer to sit down and stand up without bending your back. The occupational therapist will discuss this with you.
lumbar fusion,Activity & Recovery,When can I sleep in my own bed?,- Do I have to sleep in a recliner? <br>- Is it okay to sleep in my bed right away? <br>- What's the best place to sleep when I get home? <br>- Can I sleep on my side? <br>- What are the rules for sleeping?,"You can sleep in your bed as soon as you get home, as long as you use the ""log roll"" technique to get in and out of it. However, many people find it more comfortable to sleep in a recliner for the first week or two. The most important thing is that you are comfortable and getting rest."
lumbar fusion,Activity & Recovery,How do I get in and out of a car?,- What's the right way to get into a car? <br>- Is there a special technique for car travel? <br>- How do I avoid bending when getting in a car? <br>- Can I ride in a small car? <br>- What are the instructions for riding in a car?,"You should use a mid-size or larger car. To get in, back up to the passenger seat, reach back for support, and lower yourself down without bending your back. Then, keep your knees together and swing your legs into the car. Reverse the process to get out. We recommend reclining the seat slightly for comfort."
lumbar fusion,Long-Term Outlook,"Will I have a ""flat back"" after this surgery?","- Does the surgery change the curve in my lower back? <br>- Will my back look different? <br>- What is ""flatback syndrome""? <br>- Do you restore the natural curve of the spine? <br>- Will my posture be normal?","One of the key goals of modern lumbar fusion is to restore the normal, gentle sway (lordosis) of your lower back, not to make it flat. By using specially shaped cages and contouring the rods, we work to recreate your natural spinal alignment, which is critical for a good long-term outcome."
lumbar fusion,Long-Term Outlook,Will I be able to feel the weather in my back?,- Can the hardware make my back ache when it rains? <br>- Is it true that you can feel storms in your joints? <br>- Does the metal get cold in the winter? <br>- Will my back be sensitive to weather changes? <br>- Can the implants cause pain in cold weather?,"Some patients with any type of implant, whether it's in their spine or their knee, report that they feel more achy when the weather changes. The hardware itself doesn't get cold, but changes in barometric pressure can affect the tissues around it. However, many patients don't notice this at all."
lumbar fusion,Long-Term Outlook,Can I get another surgery if this one doesn't work?,- What if the fusion doesn't take away my pain? <br>- Is a revision surgery possible? <br>- What are the options if I'm still in pain a year later? <br>- Can you re-do a fusion? <br>- What is the plan if the surgery fails?,"Our goal is to get it right the first time, and the vast majority of patients do very well. In the rare event that the bones don't fuse or you continue to have significant pain, a revision or second surgery can be an option, but it is a complex decision that we would explore carefully after a full year of recovery."
lumbar fusion,Follow-Up,Why do I need to be followed for so long?,- Why do I need to come back for a year? <br>- What is the purpose of all the follow-up visits? <br>- Can I just stop coming if I feel good? <br>- What is the long-term monitoring plan? <br>- How many appointments will I have?,A fusion takes a long time to become solidâup to a year or more. It is very important that we monitor the healing process with x-rays to make sure the bones are growing together properly and the hardware is in a good position. These follow-up visits are essential to ensuring your long-term success.
lumbar fusion,Follow-Up,What if I have a problem after hours or on the weekend?,- Who do I call if I have an emergency? <br>- Is there a doctor on call? <br>- What do I do if I have a question at night? <br>- How do I get in touch with you after hours? <br>- What is the emergency contact process?,"Our office has a physician on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you have an urgent concern after normal business hours, you can call our main office number, and the answering service will have the on-call doctor get in touch with you. For a true medical emergency, you should always call 911."
lumbar fusion,Follow-Up,What are the warning signs I should call about right away?,- What symptoms are considered an emergency? <br>- When should I call your office? <br>- What are the red flags I need to watch for? <br>- What kind of problems should I report immediately? <br>- What are the signs of a serious complication?,"You should call us immediately if you develop a fever higher than 101 degrees, have drainage from your incision that is increasing or looks like pus, experience significant new redness or swelling around the incision, or have any new, worsening numbness or weakness in your legs."
cervical disc replacement,About the Procedure,What is a cervical disc replacement?,- Can you explain what a disc arthroplasty is? <br>- How is this different from a fusion? <br>- What does it mean to get an artificial disc? <br>- Is this the surgery that preserves motion? <br>- Why am I getting a replacement instead of a fusion?,"A cervical disc replacement, or arthroplasty, is a surgery where we remove the damaged, painful disc in your neck and replace it with an artificial prosthesis. The key benefit is that the artificial disc is designed to move and function like your natural disc, which preserves your neck's motion at that level."
cervical disc replacement,About the Procedure,Why do I need this surgery?,- What condition does a disc replacement treat? <br>- Why is this the right surgery for me? <br>- How will an artificial disc help my symptoms? <br>- What is causing my neck and arm pain? <br>- Is this to fix a herniated disc in my neck?,"You are having this surgery because a damaged disc in your neck is pressing on your nerves or spinal cord. This is what's causing your symptoms, such as pain in the neck and arm, or numbness and weakness in your fingers. By removing the bad disc and replacing it, we relieve that pressure and stop the pain."
cervical disc replacement,About the Procedure,Am I a good candidate for a disc replacement?,- Why can some people get a replacement and others need a fusion? <br>- What makes someone eligible for an artificial disc? <br>- Does everyone with a bad disc get this surgery? <br>- Are there reasons I couldn't have a replacement? <br>- Who qualifies for this procedure?,"A disc replacement is an excellent option for many patients, but it's not for everyone. It's typically recommended for patients with a disc problem who do not have significant arthritis in the joints of their neck or major instability. I have determined from your specific condition and imaging that you are a great candidate for this motion-preserving procedure."
cervical disc replacement,About the Procedure,How is this different from a hip or knee replacement?,- Is this like the joint replacements my parents had? <br>- Is the technology similar to other joint replacements? <br>- What are the similarities to a knee replacement? <br>- Is it the same kind of implant? <br>- How does this compare to other arthroplasty surgeries?,"The concept is very similar. Just like in a hip or knee replacement, we are removing a worn-out, painful joint (your disc) and replacing it with an artificial implant that restores function. The goal in all these procedures is to relieve pain and restore motion."
cervical disc replacement,The Implant,What is the artificial disc made of?,- What materials are used in the implant? <br>- Is the implant plastic or metal? <br>- Can I have an allergic reaction to the disc? <br>- What is the composition of the artificial disc? <br>- Is there any metal in the replacement disc?,"The artificial discs we use are typically made of a combination of medical-grade metal alloys, such as cobalt-chromium or titanium, and a highly durable medical-grade plastic, similar to what is used in hip and knee replacements. These materials are very safe and biocompatible."
cervical disc replacement,The Implant,How long will the artificial disc last?,- Will I ever need to have the implant replaced? <br>- Is this a permanent solution? <br>- What is the lifespan of the artificial disc? <br>- Does the implant wear out over time? <br>- Is a second surgery to replace the implant common?,"The artificial discs are made of very durable materials and are designed to last for a very long time, likely for the rest of your life. The technology has been tested extensively to withstand the normal stresses of neck movement for many decades. Revision surgery for a worn-out disc is not expected."
cervical disc replacement,The Implant,How does the artificial disc stay in place?,- What keeps the implant from slipping? <br>- Is the disc attached with screws? <br>- How is the implant secured to the bone? <br>- What is the fixation method? <br>- Could the implant become dislodged?,"The surfaces of the implant that touch the vertebrae have a special porous coating. Your bone will naturally grow into this surface over the first few weeks, creating a strong, biological bond that holds it securely in place. The initial fit is very snug, and this bone growth makes it permanent."
cervical disc replacement,The Implant,Will I be able to feel the implant moving?,- Is the motion of the artificial disc noticeable? <br>- Will my neck feel different when I move it? <br>- Can you sense the implant working? <br>- Does it feel mechanical? <br>- Will it click or make noise?,"No, you will not be able to feel the implant moving. The motion is designed to be smooth and to mimic your natural disc. Your neck should simply feel more comfortable and less painful as you move it. The implants do not click or make noise."
cervical disc replacement,The Surgery,How is the surgery performed?,- Can you walk me through the procedure? <br>- What is the surgical process for a disc replacement? <br>- Where do you make the incision? <br>- How do you get to the spine? <br>- What happens in the operating room?,"The surgery is done through a small incision on the front of your neck, in a natural skin crease to minimize the scar. We gently move the neck muscles and structures aside to get to the spine. Then, I remove the damaged disc and place the artificial disc in its place. The whole procedure is done very carefully with your safety as our top priority."
cervical disc replacement,The Surgery,How long does the operation take?,- How many hours will I be in surgery? <br>- What is the duration of a disc replacement? <br>- Is it a long surgery? <br>- How much time does the procedure itself require? <br>- What is the estimated surgical time?,"The surgery itself is quite efficient. From the first incision to closing, it typically takes about 60 to 90 minutes for a single-level disc replacement."
cervical disc replacement,Risks & Complications,What are the main risks of this surgery?,- Is cervical disc replacement dangerous? <br>- What are the most common complications? <br>- What can go wrong with this operation? <br>- What are the potential side effects? <br>- What should I be most concerned about?,"While this is a very safe procedure, all surgeries have risks. The most common issues are temporary, like a sore throat or hoarseness. More serious complications, like infection, bleeding, or nerve injury, are incredibly rare in our practice. There is also a small risk the implant could shift, but we take every precaution to prevent this."
cervical disc replacement,Risks & Complications,What happens if the implant moves or gets displaced?,- Could the artificial disc slip out of place? <br>- Is it possible for the implant to shift? <br>- What is the risk of implant migration? <br>- How do you fix a displaced implant? <br>- What would cause the disc to move?,"The risk of the implant moving is very low. It is sized and placed to fit very securely, and your bone grows into it to lock it in place. In the extremely rare event that it did shift and cause a problem, a second surgery might be needed to fix it, which would likely involve converting it to a fusion."
cervical disc replacement,Risks & Complications,Is it true I could have trouble singing high notes?,- Can the surgery affect my singing voice? <br>- Why is damage to the laryngeal nerve a risk? <br>- Could my voice change permanently? <br>- What causes the hoarseness after surgery? <br>- Is injury to the vocal cords common?,"There is a nerve called the superior laryngeal nerve that controls your ability to hit high notes. It is near the surgical area and can be stretched or irritated, which is usually temporary. The risk of permanent damage to this nerve or the main vocal cord nerve is very rare, but we are obligated to discuss it with you."
cervical disc replacement,Risks & Complications,How is this different from the risks of a fusion?,- Is a replacement safer than a fusion? <br>- Are the complications different for arthroplasty? <br>- Does this surgery have fewer risks than a fusion? <br>- What are the pros and cons of replacement vs. fusion? <br>- Why choose this over a fusion?,"Many of the immediate surgical risks are the same, since the approach to the spine is identical. The main difference is in the long-term. A disc replacement avoids the risks associated with fusion, such as the bones failing to heal (""pseudoarthrosis"") and may reduce the risk of causing problems at the adjacent levels later on."
cervical disc replacement,Preparation,Do I need to stop taking anti-inflammatory medicine before this surgery?,- Can I take Advil or Motrin before a disc replacement? <br>- Why do I have to stop taking NSAIDs? <br>- Which pain medicines are okay before surgery? <br>- Is it okay to take aspirin? <br>- What about my arthritis medicine?,"Yes, it is very important. You must stop all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like Ibuprofen, Aleve, and Aspirin for one to two weeks before surgery. These medications can increase bleeding during the procedure. Tylenol is safe to continue taking."
cervical disc replacement,Preparation,What happens on the day of surgery?,- What is the process when I arrive at the hospital? <br>- Can you walk me through the morning of the operation? <br>- What should I expect before I go to the operating room? <br>- Who will I meet on surgery day? <br>- What is the pre-op process?,"You will arrive about two hours before your scheduled surgery time. The nursing and anesthesia teams will get you ready, which includes starting an IV. You will meet with the anesthesiologist to discuss their plan, and I will also see you to answer any last-minute questions before we go to the operating room."
cervical disc replacement,Hospital Stay,How long will I be in the hospital?,- Is this an outpatient procedure? <br>- Will I go home the same day? <br>- What is the average hospital stay? <br>- Do I have to stay overnight? <br>- When am I discharged?,"Most patients who have a cervical disc replacement go home the same day or the morning after the surgery. As long as your pain is well-controlled and you are medically stable, you can safely recover in the comfort of your own home."
cervical disc replacement,Hospital Stay,Will I have a drain in my neck after surgery?,- What is the purpose of the drain? <br>- How long does the drain stay in? <br>- Is the tube in my neck painful to remove? <br>- Why is there a drain coming from the incision? <br>- Does everyone get a drain?,"You may have a small, temporary drain coming from your incision. This is to remove any excess fluid from under the skin, which helps reduce swelling. If you have one, it is typically removed without any pain before you leave the hospital."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,Will I need to wear a neck brace?,- Do I have to wear a collar after a disc replacement? <br>- For how long do I need a brace? <br>- Why don't I need a hard collar like with a fusion? <br>- Is a soft collar necessary? <br>- What are the rules for the brace?,"We will provide you with a soft cervical collar, but it is purely for your comfort. Because the implant is designed to allow motion and is stable right away, you do not need to wear the collar. You can remove it whenever you like. This is a major advantage over fusion surgery."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,What are my activity restrictions?,- What am I not allowed to do after surgery? <br>- How careful do I need to be with my neck? <br>- What are the main limitations? <br>- Are there things I should avoid doing? <br>- Can you explain the post-op restrictions?,"The main restrictions are to avoid any aggressive or extreme neck motions and to avoid lifting anything heavy, generally more than 15 pounds, for the first few weeks. We want the implant to settle in and for your bone to grow into it. Otherwise, walking is your best activity."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,How soon can I return to work?,- How much time do I need off from my job? <br>- What is the recovery time before I can work? <br>- When can I go back to my desk job? <br>- How long is the recovery for a physical job? <br>- When am I cleared to work?,"The return-to-work time is generally faster than with a fusion. Many people with desk jobs can return within one to two weeks. If you have a more physically demanding job, you may need four to six weeks. We will discuss your specific situation."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,When can I drive a car?,- How long until I am allowed to drive? <br>- Is it safe to drive after a neck replacement? <br>- What are the rules for driving? <br>- How soon can I get behind the wheel? <br>- When will I be cleared to drive?,"You should not drive as long as you are taking narcotic pain medications. Because this surgery preserves motion, you will be able to turn your head much sooner than with a fusion. Most patients are able to drive within a week or two, as long as they feel safe and comfortable."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,What is the best way to sleep?,- What sleeping position is best after neck surgery? <br>- Can I sleep on my side or stomach? <br>- Do I need to sleep in a recliner? <br>- How can I sleep comfortably? <br>- Are there any rules for sleeping?,"For the first few days, sleeping with your head slightly elevated on a couple of pillows or in a recliner can help reduce swelling. After that, you can sleep on your back or your side, whichever is most comfortable for you."
cervical disc replacement,Symptom Recovery,How quickly will my arm pain and numbness go away?,- Will I wake up and feel better immediately? <br>- When will the pain in my arm stop? <br>- How long does it take for the numbness in my fingers to resolve? <br>- Is the relief of symptoms immediate? <br>- Why do I still have some tingling?,"Most patients experience immediate relief from their arm pain. Numbness and tingling, however, can take longer to resolve. Nerves heal very slowly, so it may take several weeks or even months for those symptoms to fully disappear. It's important to be patient with the healing process."
cervical disc replacement,Long-Term Outlook,Can I return to sports and other activities?,- Will I be able to play golf or tennis again? <br>- When can I go back to the gym? <br>- Are there any permanent restrictions on my activity? <br>- How long until I can exercise normally? <br>- Will I be able to run again?,"Yes, a major benefit of disc replacement is a faster and more complete return to activities. Once the initial healing period is over, usually around 6-12 weeks, most patients can return to all of their previous activities, including sports, without restrictions."
cervical disc replacement,Follow-Up,How do you check on the artificial disc?,- Will I need x-rays after the surgery? <br>- How do you make sure the implant is working correctly? <br>- What happens at my follow-up appointments? <br>- Do I need an MRI to check the disc? <br>- How is my progress monitored?,"We will take x-rays at your follow-up appointments. These images allow us to check the position of the implant and, very importantly, to see that it is maintaining motion. These ""flexion-extension"" x-rays confirm that the surgery was a success."
cervical disc replacement,About the Procedure,How big will the scar on my neck be?,- Will I have a big cut on my neck? <br>- What will the scar look like? <br>- Is the incision very noticeable? <br>- How do you hide the scar? <br>- Will people be able to see my scar?,"The incision is small and made horizontally in a natural skin crease on the front of your neck. This helps it to heal in a very cosmetic way. Over the course of a year, the incision will usually fade so that it is hardly noticeable to anyone."
cervical disc replacement,About the Procedure,What happens if I wait and don't have the surgery?,- What are the risks of postponing this surgery? <br>- Can my neck problem get worse without the operation? <br>- Is it dangerous to wait to have this done? <br>- What if I decide against surgery for now? <br>- Are there consequences to delaying the procedure?,"If a disc is compressing your nerves or spinal cord, waiting can allow that pressure to cause more permanent damage. This could lead to worsening pain, increased numbness, or progressive weakness in your arms and hands that may not be reversible later on."
cervical disc replacement,The Implant,How does the artificial disc actually move?,- What makes the implant bend? <br>- Is there a hinge inside the disc? <br>- Can you explain the mechanics of the implant? <br>- What allows the disc to preserve motion? <br>- How does the device work?,"The implant is typically made of two metal endplates that anchor to your vertebrae and a medical-grade plastic core that sits between them. This core allows the metal plates to glide and rotate smoothly against each other, mimicking the natural bending, flexing, and turning of a healthy disc."
cervical disc replacement,The Implant,Can the implant be seen on an X-ray?,- Will the artificial disc show up on an X-ray? <br>- How do you check the implant after surgery? <br>- Is the device visible on imaging? <br>- Can you see the disc on an MRI? <br>- How do you monitor the implant?,"Yes, the metal components of the artificial disc are clearly visible on an x-ray. This is very helpful for us, as it allows us to check the position and, most importantly, the motion of the implant at your follow-up appointments to ensure it's working perfectly."
cervical disc replacement,The Implant,What happens if I need an MRI in the future?,- Is it safe to get an MRI with this implant? <br>- Will the artificial disc affect an MRI scan? <br>- Can I have an MRI of my brain or shoulder later? <br>- Are there any restrictions on future imaging? <br>- Is the implant MRI-compatible?,"Yes, the materials used in modern artificial discs are MRI-compatible. You can safely have an MRI of your neck or any other part of your body in the future. The metal may cause some distortion on the images immediately around the implant, but it does not pose a danger."
cervical disc replacement,The Surgery,Will I be awake during the surgery?,- What kind of anesthesia is used? <br>- Will I be put to sleep for the operation? <br>- Can I have this done with just a nerve block? <br>- How are you going to make sure I don't feel anything? <br>- Is general anesthesia required?,"No, you will be completely and comfortably asleep under general anesthesia. You will not feel or remember anything about the procedure. Our expert anesthesia team will be with you the entire time, monitoring you closely to ensure your safety."
cervical disc replacement,The Surgery,Will you be using a microscope?,- How do you see what you're doing in my neck? <br>- Do you use magnification for this surgery? <br>- What tools do you use to protect the nerves? <br>- How can you be so precise? <br>- Is this a microsurgery?,"Yes, I perform this surgery using a high-powered operating microscope. This provides a magnified, well-lit view of the delicate structures of your spine, including your spinal cord and nerves. This allows me to work with extreme precision and safety."
cervical disc replacement,The Surgery,Will I need a blood transfusion?,- Is it common to need blood for this surgery? <br>- How much blood is typically lost? <br>- Should I donate my own blood beforehand? <br>- What are the chances I'll need a transfusion? <br>- Is bleeding a major concern?,"It is very unusual to need a blood transfusion for this procedure. The surgery is done through a small incision and the blood loss is typically minimal. We do not expect you to require any blood products, but we will have you sign a consent form in the rare event of a life-threatening emergency."
cervical disc replacement,Risks & Complications,Could the surgery make my pain worse?,- Is it possible my symptoms could be worse after the operation? <br>- What if the surgery doesn't work? <br>- Can a disc replacement fail to relieve pain? <br>- Is there a chance I'll be in more pain afterward? <br>- What is the likelihood of the pain not improving?,"While the goal is to relieve your symptoms, there is a very small chance that the pain may not improve or could temporarily worsen due to nerve inflammation after being decompressed. However, the vast majority of patients experience a significant improvement in their arm pain and nerve-related symptoms."
cervical disc replacement,Risks & Complications,What happens if my bones are too soft for the implant?,- Could my bones be too weak for a replacement? <br>- What if I have osteoporosis? <br>- Can the implant sink into the bone? <br>- How do you know my bones are strong enough? <br>- Is bone quality a factor in this surgery?,"That's an excellent question. We evaluate your bone quality on your pre-operative imaging. Disc replacement relies on strong bone for the implant to anchor into. If there is significant osteoporosis or the bone is too soft, a fusion, which doesn't rely on the same type of fixation, might be a safer and more reliable option."
cervical disc replacement,Preparation,Do I need to get any special tests before surgery?,- What is a pre-op workup? <br>- Will I need blood work or an EKG? <br>- What kind of medical clearance do I need? <br>- Are there any tests I have to do before the operation? <br>- What does pre-testing involve?,"Yes, before your surgery, we will have you get some standard pre-operative tests, which may include blood work, a urinalysis, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. This is to ensure you are in the best possible health for anesthesia and the procedure itself."
cervical disc replacement,Preparation,What should I do the morning of my surgery?,- Are there any instructions for the day of the operation? <br>- How should I get ready on surgery day? <br>- What is the morning routine before coming to the hospital? <br>- Can I take my regular morning medicine? <br>- Should I shower on the morning of surgery?,"You can shower the morning of your surgery. You should not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before. The anesthesia team will give you specific instructions about which of your regular medications, like blood pressure pills, you should take with a small sip of water."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,How much pain will I be in when I wake up?,- Is the recovery very painful? <br>- What is the post-op pain like? <br>- How bad does it hurt right after the operation? <br>- What should I expect for pain immediately after surgery? <br>- Will I be on strong pain medicine?,"You will wake up with some pain at the incision site and a sore throat, which is normal. Many patients notice their arm pain is gone right away. We will have a variety of medications available, including IV pain medicine and muscle relaxants, to keep you as comfortable as possible."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,Will I have pain between my shoulder blades?,- Why does my upper back hurt after neck surgery? <br>- Is shoulder blade pain a normal side effect? <br>- What causes the pain between my shoulders? <br>- How long will my shoulder blades ache? <br>- Is it common to have this kind of pain?,"Yes, it is very common to have an aching pain between your shoulder blades. When we remove the old disc and place the new implant, we are restoring the normal height of that space. This can stretch the muscles and ligaments in your neck, and that feeling is often referred to between the shoulder blades. It will gradually improve over a few weeks."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,Can I take Advil or Motrin after the surgery?,- Is it okay to take anti-inflammatory medicine for pain? <br>- When can I start taking NSAIDs again? <br>- Which pain relievers are safe after a disc replacement? <br>- Can I take ibuprofen for muscle soreness? <br>- Are there any medicines I should avoid?,"Yes, this is another major advantage over fusion. Because we are not trying to get bone to heal, you are allowed to take anti-inflammatory medications like Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and Naproxen (Aleve) after the surgery to help with pain and soreness."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,When can I go up and down stairs?,- Are stairs okay to do after I get home? <br>- Will I be able to use the stairs in my house? <br>- Are there any restrictions on climbing stairs? <br>- Is it safe to use stairs right away? <br>- Do I need help with stairs?,"Yes, you can use stairs as soon as you get home. We just advise you to take them slowly and use a handrail for stability. There are no specific restrictions against using stairs."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,How long will I need to take the strong pain pills?,- How long will I be on narcotics? <br>- When can I switch to just Tylenol or Advil? <br>- Do most people need the prescription pain medicine for long? <br>- What is the typical duration for taking narcotics? <br>- How long until I'm off the pain meds?,Most patients only need the narcotic pain medication for a few days up to a week. The goal is to transition to over-the-counter medications like Tylenol or anti-inflammatories as soon as your pain allows.
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,"What does ""avoid extremes of motion"" mean?",- Can you give me examples of movements to avoid? <br>- How much can I move my neck? <br>- What kind of neck movements are not allowed? <br>- Should I try to keep my neck still? <br>- How careful do I need to be?,"It means you should avoid forcing your neck into uncomfortable positions. For the first few weeks, avoid looking all the way up to the ceiling or trying to touch your chin to your chest. Gentle, normal day-to-day movements are perfectly fine and encouraged."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,Will I need physical therapy?,- Is PT a part of the recovery? <br>- When would I start physical therapy? <br>- What will I do in physical therapy? <br>- Is rehab necessary after this surgery? <br>- Do you prescribe physical therapy?,"Most patients do not require formal physical therapy after a disc replacement. The best therapy is to gradually increase your normal activities and walking. If you have any significant weakness or stiffness, we may prescribe therapy later in your recovery to help with that."
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,When can I resume sexual activity?,- How long should I wait to be intimate? <br>- Are there any restrictions on sex after surgery? <br>- Is it safe to have sex after a neck replacement? <br>- What are the guidelines for sexual relations? <br>- When is it okay to be intimate again?,You may resume sexual relations whenever you feel comfortable. The safest position is generally lying flat on your back to avoid any strain on your neck. Listen to your body and avoid any positions that cause discomfort.
cervical disc replacement,After Surgery & Recovery,How do I take care of the incision?,- What are the wound care instructions? <br>- How do I keep my incision clean? <br>- Can I put ointment on the scar? <br>- What do I do if the dressing comes off? <br>- How do I clean the incision area?,"You will have a waterproof dressing that you can remove after 3 days. Underneath, you may have skin glue that will dissolve on its own. You can let soap and water run over the incision in the shower, but don't scrub it. Gently pat it dry. Do not apply any ointments or creams."
cervical disc replacement,Long-Term Outlook,Will this surgery affect the other discs in my neck?,- Does getting a replacement put stress on the other levels? <br>- Could I have problems with other discs later on? <br>- What is adjacent segment disease? <br>- Does this protect my other discs from wearing out? <br>- Is this better for the rest of my neck than a fusion?,"This is one of the main theoretical advantages of disc replacement. By preserving motion at the surgical level, it may help protect the adjacent discs from wearing out faster, which can sometimes happen after a fusion. The goal is to keep your neck moving in a more natural way."
cervical disc replacement,Long-Term Outlook,Are there any permanent restrictions after I'm fully healed?,- Will I ever have to limit my activities in the future? <br>- Are there any sports I can never do again? <br>- Do I have to be careful with my neck forever? <br>- Will I be able to do everything I did before? <br>- What are the long-term limitations?,"Once you are fully healed, there are generally no permanent restrictions. The goal of this surgery is to allow you to return to all of your normal activities, including sports, without limitation. We want you to get back to living your life fully."
cervical disc replacement,Follow-Up,What happens at my first follow-up visit?,- What should I expect at my two-week check-up? <br>- Why do I need to come back so soon after surgery? <br>- What is the purpose of the first post-op appointment? <br>- What will you do at my first follow-up? <br>- Do you take x-rays at the first visit?,Your first follow-up appointment is typically a few weeks after surgery. It's primarily a wound check to make sure your incision is healing nicely. It's also a great opportunity for you to ask any questions that have come up and for us to see how you are progressing. We may or may not take an x-ray at this first visit.
cervical disc replacement,Follow-Up,How often do I need to be seen after the surgery?,- What is the schedule for follow-up appointments? <br>- How many times do I need to come back? <br>- What is the long-term follow-up plan? <br>- When are the check-up visits? <br>- How long do you follow patients after this surgery?,"We will see you for several follow-up visits over the first year to monitor your progress with x-rays. After the one-year mark, we typically do not need to see you back unless you are having a problem. However, we are always here for you if you need us."
