microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What pain medications should I stop before my microdiscectomy?,Can I take Aleve for a headache before my surgery?; Which over-the-counter pain meds are not allowed,"You must stop all NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) at least 7 days before your surgery. This includes Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), Naproxen (Aleve), Meloxicam, and Diclofenac. Tylenol (Acetaminophen) is generally safe to continue."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What about my blood thinners like Aspirin or Plavix?,Do I have to stop my daily low-dose aspirin?; What is the plan for my prescription blood thinner?,"It is essential that you discuss stopping any blood thinner (Aspirin, Plavix, Xarelto, Eliquis, Coumadin) with the prescribing doctor (e.g., your cardiologist). We will provide specific instructions based on their recommendations, but our standard protocol requires stopping them 5-7 days before surgery."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What about medications like Neurontin or Lyrica (gabapentin or pregabalin)?,Should I change the dose of my nerve medicine?; Is it safe to continue taking gabapentin?; Should I stop taking gabapentin?,"These are nerve medications and help to calm down irritated or excited nerves. If you are currently on one of these medications, you should not stop taking the med before surgery. Continue to take the medications through surgery until you are told to stop it by the surgeon. If you stop it too early, it can cause a rebound hypersensitivity."
microdiscectomy,Diet & Lifestyle,Do I need to stop eating or drinking before surgery?,What does it mean to be 'NPO'?; Can I have a mint or chew gum on the morning of surgery?,"Yes. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes water, coffee, and chewing gum. You may take approved morning medications with a small sip of water."
microdiscectomy,Day of Surgery,What should I wear to the hospital?,What are the best clothes to wear home from the hospital?; Are there any clothing recommendations for surgery day?,"Please wear loose, comfortable clothing that is easy to put on and take off, such as sweatpants and a zip-up or button-up shirt. Avoid anything that you have to pull tightly over your head."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,How much can I walk after my microdiscectomy?,What are my activity restrictions after the operation?; When can I start exercising again?,"Walking is your most important recovery activity. We want you up and walking the day of your surgery. Start with short, frequent walks around your house and gradually increase the distance each day as you feel comfortable."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,Are there any movements I should avoid after surgery?,What does 'BLT restrictions' mean?; Can I bend over to tie my shoes? ,"Yes. For the first 4-6 weeks, you must avoid the ""BLTs"": Bending at the waist, Lifting more than 10 pounds (a gallon of milk), and Twisting your torso. The surgeon calls this his ""Spine Diet"" - you can eat a BLT but don't do a BLT!"
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What symptoms should I watch for that require an urgent call?,,"Please call our office immediately if you experience any of the following: fever over 101.5Â°F, new or worsening weakness in your legs or feet, loss of bowel or bladder control, or clear drainage from your incision that soaks the dressing."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,What is a microlumbar discectomy (MLD)?,What is this?; What am i having done?,"A microlumbar discectomy, or MLD, is a minimally invasive surgery we perform to relieve pressure on the nerves in your lower back. ""Micro"" means small, ""lumbar"" refers to your lower back, and ""discectomy"" means to remove the part of the spinal disc that is causing the problem. We make a very small incision and gently separate the back muscles instead of cutting them, which helps you heal faster with less scarring. We approach the spine by placing a small tube between the muscle fibers - nothing is cut out. We use a microscope to look through this tube and into the spinal canal."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Will I be asleep for the surgery? ,,"Yes, you will be completely asleep for the surgery. You will have what we call a general anesthesia. This is when the anesthesiologist gives you IV medication to make you fall alseep. You will have a small tube in your mouth to protect your airway and help you breathe while laying facedown during the surgery. Patients often do not remember anything about the surgery because of the medications that make you sleep."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,How do you get to spine?,,You will be face down on a special bed during the surgery. We have special memory foam pads to keep you comfortable in this position. We can then see you back and get to the spine through an incision that is often just the width of a thumb.
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Why do I need this surgery?,,"You're having this surgery because a spinal disc in your lower back has bulged or ruptured, and it's pressing on a nerve. This pressure is what causes the pain, numbness, or weakness you've been feeling in your leg, often called 'sciatica'. We've tried other treatments like medication and physical therapy without enough success, so this surgery is the next step to remove that pressure and relieve your symptoms."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Do you put anything back into the disc or refill it?,,"Unfortunately, once you have lost disc material there is currently no way to gain it back. Placing substances back into the disc to refill it could potentially lead to complications or a recurrent herniation."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Do you do anything to close the hole in the disc?,,Usually no. Multiple studies have been done evaluting this concept and found that the rate of recurrent herniation does not change. If anything these efforts to close the hole in the disc just lead to more scar tissue and higher rates of nerve injury or dural tears.
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,What is a dural tear or durotomy?,,"A durotomy or dural tear is when a small tear occurs in the lining of the nerve roots. This sac contains the spinal fluid. If there is a tear the spinal fluid can leak out. This can lead to headaches, photophobia (troubles being in bright light) or cause a persistent leakage of fluid through the incision which could lead to infection. The rate of this adverse event is very low. Call the surgeon immediately if you notice any of these symptoms. If you have a dural tear it is often treated with bedrest for a short time. It does not effect the success of the surgery in regards to improving the nerve symptoms."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Do you cut or remove any bone during this surgery?,,Not really. We sometimes shave a small area of bone in the interlaminar window (the hole in your spine that we access the nerves through) but this is often not required. Care is taken to avoid disrupting the bony stability of the spine.
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,How successful is this surgery?,,"This procedure is very effective, especially for relieving leg pain. It is about 95% successful in taking away the leg pain caused by a herniated disc."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,What are the risks of this surgery?,,"While this is a very safe procedure, every surgery has risks. The most common ones include a 5 to 10 percent chance that the disc could herniate again, a small risk of infection (about 1%), and an even smaller risk of a spinal fluid leak (about 3%). Serious nerve injury is very rare, happening in less than 1 out of every 1,000 surgeries. We will do everything we can to minimize these risks."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,What happens during the surgery?,,"You will be under general anesthesia, so you'll be asleep and comfortable. We will have you lying face down. Using an X-ray for guidance, I'll make a small incision in your back, about an inch long, directly over the problem area. Instead of cutting your back muscles, we use special tools to gently separate them. Through a small tube, and with the help of a microscope, I will remove the piece of the disc that is pressing on your nerve. Sometimes, I might remove a tiny bit of bone to get to the disc. Once the pressure is off the nerve, I'll remove the tube, your muscles will come back together, and I'll close the incision. The whole surgery usually takes about an hour."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,Will I need a blood transfusion?,,"It is very unusual for a patient to need blood during this type of surgery. The blood loss is typically very minimal, usually less than half a cup and often less than a tablespoon"
microdiscectomy,Before Surgery,What is a disc herniation?,,A disc herniation is when a piece of the disc (the soft tissue shock absorber between the bone blocks) squirts out and causes compression on a nerve root. This is what causes your leg pain or other symptoms. Think of the disc like a jelly donut in terms of its composition. It has a tougher fibrous outer layer and a softer jelly like core.
microdiscectomy,Before Surgery,How do I prepare for surgery?,,"Before your surgery, you'll have a medical check-up to make sure you're ready. It's important to stop taking certain medications and supplements that can thin your blood, like aspirin, anti-inflammatories (Ibuprofen, Aleve), and some herbal supplements, usually one to two weeks before your surgery. We will give you specific instructions on which ones to stop and when. Also, if you smoke, stopping now will significantly improve your healing and your chances of a successful outcome. On the day before surgery, we recommend eating light meals and not eating or drinking anything after midnight."
microdiscectomy,Before Surgery,Do I really need to stop smoking?,,"Yes, it's very important. Smoking slows down your body's ability to heal and increases your risk for infection. Quitting, even for a short time before surgery, makes a big difference and helps ensure you have the best possible result."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,How long will I be in the hospital?,,"This is an outpatient procedure, which means most patients go home on the same day as their surgery. We'll monitor you for a few hours after you wake up, and as long as your pain is controlled and you're medically stable, you can recover in the comfort of your own home."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,What kind of pain will I have after surgery?,,"You will likely feel immediate relief from the leg pain you had before. However, it's normal to have some new pain at the incision site for a few days or weeks. Your back muscles might also be sore or have spasms. We will give you prescriptions for pain medication to manage this. It's also normal for the nerve pain in your leg to flare up a bit as the nerve heals from being compressed, but this should improve over the next few weeks."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,When will my symptoms improve after surgery?,,"Pain is often improved almost immediately after the surgery. Weakness or numbness/tingling can take longer to recover. This is because the nerve roots have to ""wake up"" after being compressed. This often occurs within a few weeks from the surgery but in unusual situations it can take up to a year for full improvement. Sometimes, the nerve is really inflammed from the disc herniation and doing the surgery can aggravate it further. In these situations, new numbness or even pain can occur after surgery. If this happens to you, speak with the surgeon as there are means of alleviating this short lived increase of symptoms."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,How do I take care of my incision?,,"Keeping the incision clean and dry is the most important thing. You will have a waterproof dressing on it. You can shower, but don't soak in a bath or pool for about six weeks. Let the water run over the incision, but don't scrub it. Afterward, just pat it dry. Your stitches are under the skin and will dissolve on their own. Sometimes we use a special skin glue that will peel off by itself over time, so please don't pick at it."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,What are my activity restrictions?,,"For the first six weeks, we want you to avoid bending, lifting more than 10-15 pounds, and twisting your back. Walking is great for you! Start with short, frequent walks around your house and gradually increase the distance. You can usually return to office work and driving after a week, as long as you are no longer taking narcotic pain medication. We'll guide you on when you can return to more strenuous activities, usually around three months for heavy work."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,When can I drive?,When is it safe to get behind the wheel?; Is it okay for my family to drive me home?,You can start driving again once you are completely off of any prescription narcotic pain medications and you feel you can step on the brake quickly and without pain.
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,Will I need physical therapy?,Do I get a referral for PT?; What is the therapy plan after this surgery?; What kind of therapy do I need after surgery?,"Ususally no. Many patients benefit from physical therapy but it is not a requirement. Your preoperative functional status (how laid up you are) impacts this more than the type of surgery.. We typically start physical therapy about 6 weeks after your surgery to help you safely strengthen the muscles in and around your back and regain your mobility if its required. We dont want to cause injury prior to this. During the first six weeks, walking is your main mode of therapy."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,When is my first follow-up appointment?,,"We will schedule your first follow-up visit for about two weeks after your surgery. This appointment is mainly to check on your incision and see how you are progressing. Then we see you around 6 weeks after surgery to determine if you are ready to resume normal activities. That is often the last appointment for most patients. Of course, if you have any concerns prior to your first appointm, you can always call us."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,When should I call the doctor's office?,,"Please call us if you experience a fever, chills, redness or drainage from your incision, or increasing back or leg pain that isn't helped by rest and medication. You should also call us if you have new swelling or pain in your calf, or a severe headache that is worse when you're sitting up. If you have trouble breathing, call 911 immediately."
microdiscectomy,Foundational,Can you explain what my lumbar microdiscectomy surgery entails?,What is the purpose of this operation?; What are you trying to fix?,"In this procedure, we will make a small incision in your lower back to carefully remove the piece of the disc that has pushed out and is pinching the nerve. The primary aim is to take the pressure off that nerve, which should alleviate the pain or weakness you're feeling down your leg."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,Are there any over-the-counter pain relievers I need to avoid before my operation?,What about meds for a headache?; Is it okay to take Motrin?; Do I have to stop taking naproxen?,"For your safety, please avoid taking any NSAID medications for one full week prior to your scheduled surgery. This category includes common drugs like Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and Naproxen (Aleve). However, if you need pain relief, Tylenol (also known as Acetaminophen) is perfectly fine to use."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What is the protocol for my blood-thinning medication?,Do I have to stop my daily aspirin?; What's the plan for my Coumadin or Xarelto?,"Any medication that thins your blood requires special management. You must consult with the doctor who prescribed it (like your heart doctor) to get their approval to pause it. Typically, we ask patients to stop these medications 5 to 7 days before the operation, but we will follow the specific guidance from your prescribing physician."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,Do I make any changes to my nerve pain medicine like Gabapentin?,Should I stop taking Lyrica?; What's the plan for my pregabalin?,"Please continue taking your prescribed nerve-calming medications (such as Neurontin, Gabapentin, Lyrica, or Pregabalin) exactly as scheduled. Do not stop them. These medications help manage nerve sensitivity, and it's beneficial to maintain a stable level in your system."
microdiscectomy,Diet & Lifestyle,What are the rules about eating and drinking before my procedure?,When do I have to stop eating?; Can I have a sip of coffee in the morning?,"To ensure your safety during anesthesia, you must have a completely empty stomach. Please do not consume any food or beverages after midnight on the eve of your surgery. A small sip of water to take essential morning pills is the only exception."
microdiscectomy,Day of Surgery,What's the best type of clothing to wear on the day of surgery?,Are there any clothing recommendations?; What should I plan to wear home?,"We recommend choosing clothes that are loose-fitting and easy to manage. Think about items like sweatpants, shorts, and shirts that button or zip up the front. The key is to avoid anything tight or anything you have to pull over your head."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What's the plan for walking after the operation?,How soon can I get up and move?; Are there walking goals?,"Walking will be your primary form of therapy. We will have you up and moving on the very day of your surgery. The goal is to take short, regular walks, increasing your time and distance gradually as your comfort allows."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,Are there specific body movements I'm not allowed to do?,What does 'BLT restrictions' mean?; Is it okay to bend or twist?,"Yes, you must protect your back for the first 4 to 6 weeks by avoiding three specific movements, which we call the ""BLTs"": No Bending forward at the waist, no Lifting anything heavier than a gallon of milk (about 10 lbs), and no Twisting of your back."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,How long until I'm allowed to drive a car again?,When is it safe to get behind the wheel?; Can someone else drive me?,"You may not operate a vehicle as long as you are taking any narcotic pain relievers. You must feel confident that you can move your foot quickly to the brake without pain or hesitation. For most, this takes about 2 to 3 weeks. Riding as a passenger is fine anytime."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,How can I use the toilet without bending or twisting?,Is it hard to go to the bathroom after surgery?; How do I wipe myself?; What if my toilet is too low?,"Using the toilet is a normal activity, but you must be mindful of your BLT restrictions. To avoid excessive bending, consider using a raised toilet seat or a safety frame with arms that you can push up on. For personal hygiene, it is critical to avoid twisting your back. We highly recommend using a long-handled grabber or a specific personal hygiene wand to help you clean yourself safely without compromising your recovery."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What is the safest way to get out of bed or a chair?,,"To get out of bed, use the ""log roll"" technique: bend your knees, roll onto your side as one single unit (like a log), and then use your arms to push yourself up to a seated position as you swing your legs off the bed. To get out of a chair, scoot to the very edge of the seat, keep your back straight, and use the power of your legs and arms to push straight up. Remember your BLT restrictions: No Bending or Twisting. Using a walker for extra support and stability is a great idea in the first few days."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What is the typical timeline for returning to my job?,How much time should I take off work?; When can I go back to my office?,"Your return-to-work date is based on your job's physical demands. For office-based or sedentary work, 2 to 4 weeks is typical. For jobs requiring physical labor, you should plan for a longer recovery of 6 to 8 weeks, possibly more, to ensure your back has healed sufficiently."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,What are the instructions for showering with the incision?,How do I keep my incision clean?; Is it okay if soap and water run over the wound?,"You can let water from the shower run over your incision starting 48 hours after your procedure. It's important not to scrub the area directly. When you're done, gently pat the site dry with a fresh towel."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,Is it safe to take a bath or get in a pool?,When can I submerge my incision in water?; Can I use a jacuzzi?,"You must keep the incision out of standing water for 4 weeks. This means no baths, swimming pools, hot tubs, or lakes until the wound is fully healed and you've been cleared by the surgeon at your follow-up appointment."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,How should I manage the dressing on my wound?,What do I do with the surgical tape?; Should I peel off the glue?,"Your incision is sealed with either steri-strips (special tape) or a surgical glue called Dermabond. You don't need to do anything with it. Leave it in place, and it will start to come off on its own in about 10 to 14 days."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What should I expect in terms of pain after the procedure?,Is it normal for the leg pain to come and go?; Will my back hurt?,You should expect to feel some soreness at the incision site itself. It's also common for the nerve-related leg pain (sciatica) to fluctuate during the healing process as the nerve recovers. This is a normal part of recovery.
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What's the best strategy for taking my pain pills?,How do I use my narcotics effectively?; How do I wean off the pain medicine?,"For the first few days, it's best to take your pain medication on a regular schedule to prevent the pain from becoming severe. As you start to feel better, you can stretch out the time between doses and begin substituting with Tylenol."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What can I do to relieve constipation from the medication?,Is it normal to get backed up?; How do I treat constipation?,"It's very common to experience constipation from anesthesia and pain medicine. We suggest you begin taking an over-the-counter stool softener, like Colace, as soon as you start the narcotics. Staying hydrated and walking frequently are also very helpful."
microdiscectomy,Physical Therapy,Is a course of physical therapy required after this surgery?,Will I get a referral for PT?; What's the therapy plan?,"Formal physical therapy is not always necessary. For the initial 6 weeks, walking is the only therapy we recommend. At your 6-week check-up, we will assess your progress and decide if a PT referral would be beneficial for you."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,When will my first post-operative check-up be?,How soon do I come back to the clinic?; What is the purpose of the first visit?,Your first appointment back in our office will be scheduled for approximately two weeks after your surgery. The main purpose of this visit is to inspect your incision and ensure your initial recovery is on track. Your next key appointment is usually 6 weeks post-op.
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,How can I tell if my incision is getting infected?,What does an infected wound look like?; Is some redness okay?,"Please contact us if you see signs of infection, such as spreading redness, increased swelling, warmth to the touch, or any thick, cloudy, or colored discharge. A small amount of pinkish or clear fluid in the first day or so is not unusual."
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,Which symptoms are considered urgent and require a phone call?,What are the emergency signs?; When should I call the on-call doctor?,"Please call us immediately for any of these ""red flag"" symptoms: a temperature above 101.5Â°F (38.6Â°C), any new or progressing weakness in your leg or foot, or any change in your ability to control your bladder or bowels."
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What does it mean if I get a bad headache that's worse when I'm upright?,Is a positional headache a problem?; Why does my head pound when I stand up?,"If you experience a severe headache that feels significantly worse when you sit or stand and improves when you lie flat, you need to call our office. This specific type of headache can be a sign of a spinal fluid leak, which we need to know about."
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What should I do about new pain or swelling in my lower leg?,Is calf pain a warning sign?; What are the symptoms of a DVT?,"New pain, tenderness, swelling, or redness that appears in your calf muscle could be a sign of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or blood clot. This is a serious condition, so please contact our office right away if you notice these symptoms."
microdiscectomy,Foundational,What is a lumbar microdiscectomy?,Why am I having this surgery?; What does the operation do?,"A lumbar microdiscectomy is a minimally invasive surgery performed to remove the portion of a herniated disc in your lower back that is pressing on a nerve. The goal is to relieve the leg pain, numbness, or weakness caused by the nerve compression."
microdiscectomy,Pre-Op Meds,What pain medications should I stop before surgery?,Can I take Advil?; Is Ibuprofen okay?; What about Aleve?; Which pain meds are not allowed?,"You must stop all NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) at least 7 days before your surgery.

microdiscectomy,Day of Surgery,What should I wear to the hospital?,What kind of clothes should I bring?; What is best to wear after surgery?,"Please wear loose, comfortable clothing that is easy to put on and take off, such as sweatpants and a zip-up or button-up shirt. Avoid anything that you have to pull tightly over your head."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,How much should I walk after surgery?,When can I start walking?; How far should I walk?,"Walking is your most important recovery activity. We want you up and walking the same day as your surgery. Start with short, frequent walks inside your house and gradually increase the distance each day as you feel comfortable."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,What movements should I avoid after surgery?,What are the BLTs?; Can I bend over?; How much can I lift?,"For the first 4-6 weeks, you must strictly avoid the ""BLTs"": Bending at the waist, Lifting more than 10 pounds (about the weight of a gallon of milk), and Twisting your torso."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,When can I drive?,When can I operate a vehicle?; Is it okay to be a passenger in a car?,"You cannot drive until you are completely off all narcotic pain medication and feel you can react safely in an emergency. For most patients, this is around 2-3 weeks. It is safe to be a passenger in a car for short trips immediately after surgery."
microdiscectomy,Post-Op Activity,When can I return to work?,How long am I off work?; When can I go back to my desk job?,"This depends on your job. If you have a sedentary desk job, you may be able to return in 2-4 weeks. If you have a physically demanding job that requires heavy lifting or manual labor, you may need to be off work for 6-8 weeks or longer."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,When can I shower after surgery?,Can I get my incision wet?; How long until I can shower?,"You may shower 48 hours after your surgery. Let the water run over the incision, but do not scrub it. Pat the area dry gently with a clean towel."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,Can I take a bath or go swimming?,Is it okay to submerge the incision?; Can I use a hot tub?,"No. Do not take a bath or submerge the incision in any water (pool, lake, hot tub) for at least 4 weeks, or until your incision is completely healed and you are cleared by your surgeon."
microdiscectomy,Incision Care,What do I do about the dressing or surgical glue?,How do I care for the steri-strips?; When does the glue come off?,Your incision is covered with surgical glue (Dermabond) or steri-strips. Do not peel or pick at these. They will begin to peel off on their own in 10-14 days. You may trim any peeling edges if they are bothersome.
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What kind of pain is normal after surgery?,Will I still have leg pain?; Why does my back hurt at the incision?,"It is normal to have localized pain at the incision site. You may also notice that your original leg pain (sciatica) is gone, but it can sometimes reappear intermittently as the nerve recovers and inflammation subsides. This is normal."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,How should I use my prescribed pain medication?,How often should I take narcotics?; How do I manage my pain?,"The goal is to stay ahead of the pain for the first few days. Take your pain medication as prescribed. As you feel better, you can begin to increase the time between doses and then switch to Tylenol (Acetaminophen) as needed."
microdiscectomy,Pain & Meds,What should I do if I am constipated?,Is constipation normal after surgery?; How can I prevent constipation?,Constipation is a very common side effect of anesthesia and narcotic pain medication. We recommend starting an over-the-counter stool softener (like Colace) when you start taking narcotics. Drinking plenty of water and walking also helps.
microdiscectomy,Physical Therapy,Will I need physical therapy?,Do I need PT?; When does physical therapy start?,"Many patients do not require formal physical therapy. Walking is your main therapy for the first 6 weeks. If you still have weakness or mobility issues at your 6-week follow-up, we will discuss if physical therapy is the right next step for you."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,When is my first follow-up appointment?,When do I see the doctor again?; What happens at the first visit?,We will schedule your first follow-up visit for about two weeks after your surgery. This appointment is mainly to check on your incision and see how you are progressing. The next visit is typically around 6 weeks after surgery.
microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What are the signs of an incision infection?,What if my incision is red?; Is drainage normal?,"Call our office if you notice increasing redness, swelling, warmth, or pus-like (thick, yellow, or green) drainage from your incision site.

microdiscectomy,Warning Signs,What if I have new pain or swelling in my calf?,Why does my leg hurt?; Could this be a blood clot?,"If you develop new, persistent pain, swelling, or redness in one of your calves (not related to your incision), this could be a sign of a blood clot (DVT). Please call our office right away."
acdf,About the Procedure,What is an Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF)?,- Can you explain what an ACDF surgery is? <br>- What does ACDF stand for and what does it mean?; What is this?; What am I having done?,"An ACDF is a type of neck surgery performed to relieve pressure on your spinal cord or nerves. We go in through the front of your neck, which is the ""Anterior"" part. Then, we remove the damaged discâthat's the ""Discectomy."" Finally, we encourage the two vertebrae to grow together into one solid bone, which is the ""Fusion."" This process stabilizes your spine and prevents the painful pressure from coming back."
acdf,About the Procedure,Why do I need to have this surgery?,- What condition does this surgery treat? <br>- Why is an ACDF recommended for me?,"You are having this surgery because a disc or a bone spur in your neck is pressing on your spinal nerves or even the spinal cord itself. This pressure is what causes symptoms like pain in your neck or arms, numbness and tingling in your fingers, weakness, or even problems with coordination and balance. The goal of the surgery is to remove that pressure and give your nerves the space they need."
acdf,The Surgery,What happens during the operation?,- Can you walk me through the surgical process? <br>- What should I expect when I'm in the operating room?,"You will be comfortably asleep under general anesthesia. I will make a small incision in a natural crease on the front of your neck. I'll gently move the throat structures aside to access your spine. Using a microscope, I will remove the damaged disc and any bone spurs that are pinching the nerves. Then, I'll place a small spacer filled with bone graft material into the empty disc space. To hold everything securely while it heals, I'll attach a small titanium plate and screws. The incision is then closed with stitches that dissolve on their own."
acdf,The Surgery,Where does the bone for the fusion come from?,- Will you have to take bone from my hip? <br>- What is the bone graft made of?,"We use a combination of materials to help your bones fuse. This includes using some of your own bone that is collected during the procedure itself, as well as a sterilized bone product from a tissue bank. In the past, it was common to take bone from a patient's hip, but we rarely need to do that anymore, which avoids the pain that used to be associated with it."
acdf,Risks & Complications,What are the risks involved with this surgery?,- Is ACDF surgery dangerous? <br>- What are the potential complications I should know about?,"While ACDF is a very safe and common procedure, all surgeries have risks. The most common side effects are temporary and include a sore throat, hoarseness, and some difficulty swallowing for a few weeks. More serious complications are very rare but can include bleeding, infection, injury to the vocal cords, or the bones not fusing properly, which might require another surgery. We take every precaution to minimize these risks."
acdf,Preparation,How do I need to prepare for my surgery?,- What do I need to do before the operation? <br>- Is there a pre-op checklist I should follow?,"Before surgery, you'll get a medical clearance from your primary doctor. It's very important that you stop taking any anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or Aleve, as well as any blood thinners, for one to two weeks before the procedure. If you smoke, you must stop, as it can prevent your bones from fusing. The night before, don't eat or drink anything after midnight. We'll give you a detailed list of instructions to follow."
acdf,Preparation,Why is it so important for me to stop smoking?,- Does smoking really affect the surgery outcome? <br>- What happens if I smoke before or after my fusion?,"Yes, it is absolutely critical. Nicotine severely restricts your blood vessels, which reduces the blood flow and oxygen that your bones need to heal and fuse together. Smoking cuts the chances of a successful fusion in half. For the best possible outcome, you need to stop smoking at least two weeks before surgery and stay smoke-free for at least three months afterward."
acdf,After Surgery,What can I expect right after I wake up from surgery?,- How will I feel immediately after the operation? <br>- Will I be in a lot of pain when I wake up?,"It's normal to have some neck and shoulder pain, as well as muscle spasms, which we will manage with medication. Many patients notice that the nerve pain in their arm is gone right away. You will likely have a sore throat and some difficulty swallowing, which is very common. Most patients stay in the hospital for one night for observation."
acdf,After Surgery,Will I have trouble swallowing?,- Is a sore throat normal after this surgery? <br>- What can I do if it's hard to swallow?,"Yes, difficulty swallowing is a very common and expected side effect. It happens because we have to gently move your esophagus and windpipe during surgery, which causes some temporary swelling. It's usually at its worst about 3 to 5 days after surgery. Eating soft foods and drinking cold things like ice water, ice cream, or smoothies can help a lot. This will get better over the next few weeks."
acdf,After Surgery,How do I take care of my incision?,- What are the instructions for wound care? <br>- When can I take the bandage off?,"Your incision will be covered with a waterproof dressing and skin glue. You can shower the day after surgery, but don't scrub the area. Just let water run over it and gently pat it dry. The dressing can usually be removed after 24 to 48 hours. Don't pick at the skin glue; it will dissolve and come off on its own. Do not put any creams or ointments on the incision."
acdf,After Surgery,Will I have to wear a neck brace?,- Do I need a cervical collar after surgery? <br>- For how long do I have to wear the brace?,"That depends on your specific surgery. If you had a fusion at multiple levels, you will likely wear a neck collar for about six to eight weeks to provide support while you heal. If you only had a single-level fusion, a collar is often not necessary. If you do need one, you can take it off for showering and eating, but you should wear it at all other times, especially when sleeping or riding in a car."
acdf,After Surgery,What are my activity restrictions after I go home?,- What am I allowed to do after surgery? <br>- How long until I can go back to my normal activities?,"For the first few weeks, you should avoid lifting anything heavier than about 10-15 pounds. There should be no repetitive bending or twisting of your neck. Walking is the best exercise you can doâstart with short, frequent walks and gradually increase your distance. You should not drive while you are taking narcotic pain medication. Most people can return to full, unrestricted activities after about 8 to 12 weeks."
acdf,Medications,Are there any medications I should avoid after surgery?,- Can I take Advil or Aleve for pain? <br>- Which pain relievers are not allowed after a fusion?,"This is extremely important: you must avoid all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. This includes common over-the-counter medications like Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and Naproxen (Aleve). These drugs can stop the bones from healing and fusing together. You should not take them for at least 3 months after surgery. We will give you a prescription for pain medication that is safe to use. Tylenol is also okay."
acdf,Follow-Up,When should I call the doctor's office?,- What are the warning signs I should look out for? <br>- What symptoms are considered an emergency?,"You should call us if you develop a fever over 101Â°F, if your incision becomes more red, swollen, or starts to drain, or if you experience worsening numbness or weakness in your arms or legs. If you have any trouble breathing or significant swelling in your neck, you should call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room immediately, as this is an emergency."
acdf,Foundational,What is an Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF)?,What does ACDF stand for?; Can you explain my neck surgery?,"An ACDF is a surgery performed through the front (""Anterior"") of your neck to relieve pressure on your spinal cord or nerves. We remove the damaged disc (""Discectomy"") and then encourage the two vertebrae to grow together into one solid bone (""Fusion""), which stabilizes the spine."
acdf,Foundational,Why do I need to have this surgery?,What condition does ACDF treat?; Why was this recommended for me?,"You are likely having this surgery because a disc or bone spur in your neck is compressing your spinal nerves or spinal cord. This pressure can cause neck/arm pain, numbness or tingling in your fingers (radiculopathy), or even issues with balance and coordination (myelopathy). The goal is to remove that pressure."
acdf,Pre-Op Prep,What medications do I need to stop before my ACDF?,Do I stop taking Advil?; What about blood thinners?,"This is critical for a fusion. You must stop all NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, Naproxen, Aleve) at least 7 days before surgery. You must also get clearance from your prescribing doctor to stop any blood thinners. Tylenol is safe to continue."
acdf,Pre-Op Prep,Are there eating or drinking restrictions before surgery?,When do I need to be NPO?; Can I have water?,"Yes. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes water, coffee, and chewing gum. You may take approved morning medications with a small sip of water."
acdf,The Cervical Collar,Will I have to wear a neck brace after surgery?,Do I get a collar?; What is the brace for?,"Yes, most patients will wake up in a cervical collar. This brace is not to help your neck heal, but rather to serve as a constant reminder to limit your neck motion and to protect the surgical site as the fusion begins."
acdf,The Cervical Collar,How long do I have to wear the collar?,When can I take the brace off?; Do I wear it 24/7?,"You should wear the collar at all times, including while sleeping, unless otherwise instructed. You may typically remove it for short periods to shower and clean the collar itself, starting 48 hours after surgery. Most patients wear the collar for 2 to 6 weeks."
acdf,Swallowing & Voice,Is it normal to have a sore throat or a hoarse voice?,Why is it hard to swallow?; Will my voice come back?,"Yes, this is very common and expected. The instruments used during surgery can irritate the nerves to your voice box and esophagus. Your throat will likely be sore, your voice may be hoarse, and you may feel a ""lump"" when you swallow. This almost always improves over several days to weeks."
acdf,Swallowing & Voice,What should I eat if it's hard to swallow?,What is the best diet after ACDF?; Are there foods to avoid?,"Start with a soft diet. Things like smoothies, yogurt, pudding, mashed potatoes, and soups are excellent choices. Avoid dry, crumbly, or tough foods like bread, crackers, and steak for the first few days, as they can be difficult to swallow."
acdf,Incision Care,How do I care for the incision on my neck?,When can I shower?; What do I do about the glue or steri-strips?,You may shower 48 hours after surgery. Let soapy water run over the incision but do not scrub it. Pat it dry gently. Your incision is sealed with surgical glue or steri-strips; do not peel them off. They will fall off on their own in 10-14 days.
acdf,Activity,How much can I lift after my ACDF?,What are my lifting restrictions?; Can I pick up my child?,"For the first 4-6 weeks, you should not lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk (about 8-10 pounds). This is to avoid straining your neck muscles and to protect the new fusion."
acdf,Activity,What other movements should I avoid?,Can I bend my neck?; Is it okay to twist my head?,You must avoid excessive or repetitive bending and twisting of your neck. Let the collar remind you. Avoid looking up at the ceiling or down at your shoes for long periods. Try to turn your whole body instead of just your neck.
acdf,Activity,When am I allowed to drive?,When is it safe to operate a car?,"You cannot drive as long as you are taking narcotic pain medication. You must also be able to turn your head comfortably enough to check blind spots and react in an emergency. For most, this is at least 2-4 weeks after surgery."
acdf,Sleeping,What is the best way to sleep after surgery?,How do I sleep with the collar on?; Can I sleep on my side?,Sleeping in a recliner or propped up in bed with several pillows is often most comfortable for the first week or two. It is safe to sleep on your back or your side. You must wear your collar while sleeping to prevent your neck from getting into an awkward position.
acdf,Medications,Which medications MUST I avoid after surgery?,Can I take Ibuprofen for pain?; Are NSAIDs okay after a fusion?,"This is extremely important: you must avoid all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for at least 3 months after surgery. This includes Advil, Motrin, Ibuprofen, Naproxen, and Aleve. These drugs can stop the bones from healing and fusing together."
acdf,Warning Signs,What symptoms require an urgent call to the office?,What are the red flags?; When should I be worried?,"Please call our office if you develop a fever over 101.5Â°F, if your incision becomes more red, swollen, or starts to drain pus, or if you experience new or worsening numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs."
acdf,Warning Signs,What symptoms are considered an emergency?,When should I call 911?; What if I can't breathe?,"If you experience significant, sudden swelling in your neck or have any difficulty breathing or catching your breath, this is an emergency. You should call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room immediately."
acdf,About the Hardware,What is the plate and screws you use made of?,Will I have metal in my neck?; What kind of hardware is it?,"We use a very small, low-profile plate and screws made of medical-grade titanium. This material is extremely strong, lightweight, and highly compatible with the body, meaning it very rarely causes any issues."
acdf,About the Hardware,Will the hardware set off metal detectors at the airport?,Do I need a doctor's note for TSA?; Will I have problems with security?,It's highly unlikely. Modern titanium hardware has a very low magnetic signature and is generally not detected by airport security scanners. You will not need a special card or note for travel.
acdf,About the Hardware,What do you use for the bone graft part of the fusion?,Where does the bone for the fusion come from?; Is it my own bone?,"For the fusion, we use a spacer that goes where the disc was, and this is filled with bone graft material to stimulate the vertebrae to grow together. We will discuss the specific type of graft material being used for your individual case before surgery."
acdf,Surgery & Hospital,How long does the ACDF operation usually take?,How long will I be in surgery?; What is the OR time?,"While every case is unique, a one or two-level ACDF surgery itself typically takes about 1 to 2 hours. You should plan on being in the operating room and recovery area for several hours total."
acdf,Surgery & Hospital,How long will I be in the hospital after surgery?,Is this an overnight stay?; When do I get to go home?,Most patients who have a one or two-level ACDF go home the same day or after a single overnight stay in the hospital. Our goal is to make sure your pain is controlled and you are able to walk safely before you are discharged.
acdf,Surgery & Hospital,Will I have a drain in my neck after surgery?,What is this tube coming out of my incision?; When does the drain come out?,"It is common to have a small, temporary surgical drain placed in the incision. This is done to prevent fluid from collecting under the skin. If you have one, it is typically removed before you leave the hospital."
acdf,Pain & Recovery,How much pain will I be in when I wake up?,Is this a very painful surgery?; What should I expect for pain control?,"You should expect to have some pain, particularly a sore throat and soreness at the incision site. We have a comprehensive pain management plan to keep you comfortable, using a combination of medications in the hospital and prescriptions for you to take at home. The severe arm pain you had before surgery is often gone immediately."
acdf,Pain & Recovery,Will I be prescribed muscle relaxers?,What can I do for neck spasms?; Are muscle spasms normal?,"Yes, neck muscle spasms are very common after this surgery as the muscles get used to the new alignment. We will typically provide a prescription for a muscle relaxer to help manage these spasms, especially for the first couple of weeks."
acdf,Recovery at Home,Will I need someone to help me at home?,Can I be alone after surgery?; What kind of help will I need?,"We strongly recommend having a friend or family member stay with you for at least the first 24-48 hours after you get home. They can help with meals, reminders for medication, and provide general support as you recover."
acdf,Recovery at Home,Is it safe for me to go up and down stairs?,Can I sleep in my upstairs bedroom?; Are stairs okay?,"Yes, you can use stairs. The key is to take them slowly and carefully. Always use the handrail for support and try to look straight ahead, rather than down at your feet, to avoid bending your neck."
acdf,Recovery at Home,What about my pets? Can I take care of my dog or cat?,Can I walk my dog?; Is it okay to bend over to feed my cat?,"You must be very careful with pets. You cannot bend your neck down to fill food or water bowls, so place them on a raised surface. You absolutely cannot walk a dog on a leash for the first 4-6 weeks, as a sudden pull could seriously injure your neck."
acdf,Long-Term Outlook,Will I lose a lot of motion in my neck forever?,How much will I be able to move my neck after it heals?; Will my neck feel stiff?,"This is a very common concern. For a one or two-level fusion, most patients notice very little, if any, change in their overall range of neck motion. The majority of your neck's rotation comes from the very top of your spine, which we are not operating on."
acdf,Long-Term Outlook,How long does it take for the fusion to be solid?,When is the bone fully healed?; What is the fusion success rate?,"A fusion is a slow process. While you will feel much better within weeks, it takes at least 3 to 6 months for the bone to become solid, and it can continue to mature for up to a year. We will track your healing with x-rays. The success rate for achieving a solid fusion is very high, typically well over 90%."
acdf,Long-Term Outlook,When can I start exercising again?,When can I go back to the gym?; What kind of exercise is safe?,"We want you walking immediately, as it's the best exercise for recovery. You can typically resume low-impact cardio, like using a stationary bike or elliptical, around 4-6 weeks. We will clear you for more strenuous activities and a return to the gym once we see evidence of a solid fusion on your x-rays."
acdf,Follow-Up,How often will I need to get x-rays after the surgery?,Will you be checking the fusion?; What are the follow-up appointments for?,"We will get an x-ray at most of your post-operative visits, typically around 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and beyond. These images are essential for us to monitor the hardware and confirm that the bones are fusing together properly."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Will this surgery fix my back pain?,"- Is this going to cure my lower backache? <br>- I thought this was for my leg, will my back feel better too? <br>- What's the main goal of this operation, back or leg pain?","The primary goal of this surgery is to relieve the leg pain, numbness, or weaknessâthe ""sciatica""âcaused by the pinched nerve. While some patients do experience an improvement in their back pain, it is not the main purpose of the procedure, and we cannot guarantee your back pain will resolve."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,How big will my scar be?,- Will I have a large incision? <br>- What will the scar look like after a microdiscectomy? <br>- Is the cut very noticeable?,"The incision is very small, typically less than an inch long. We make it as discreetly as possible. Over time, it will fade and for most patients, it becomes a very fine line that is not very noticeable."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,What happens if I don't have the surgery?,- What are the risks of waiting? <br>- Can my condition get worse without the operation? <br>- Is surgery my only option?,"If the nerve remains pinched, your leg pain, numbness, or weakness could become more severe or even permanent. While other treatments like physical therapy and injections can help, if they haven't provided enough relief, surgery is the most effective way to prevent long-term nerve damage."
microdiscectomy,About the Procedure,Is this considered major surgery?,- How serious is a microdiscectomy? <br>- Would you classify this as a big operation? <br>- Am I undergoing a major procedure?,"While any surgery is a significant event, a microdiscectomy is considered a minimally invasive and very common procedure. It's not ""open"" back surgery. The small incision and muscle-sparing technique lead to a much faster recovery compared to traditional methods."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,How long does the actual operation take?,- How many hours will I be in surgery? <br>- What is the duration of the procedure? <br>- How long will the surgeon be operating?,"The surgery itself is quite quick, usually taking about an hour from the first incision to the last stitch."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,Will I have stitches that need to be removed?,- Do I have to come back to get stitches out? <br>- What kind of sutures do you use? <br>- Are the stitches dissolvable?,"We use sutures that are all underneath the skin and they will dissolve on their own, so you won't need to have any stitches removed at your follow-up appointment. We also use a special skin glue that will peel off over time."
microdiscectomy,The Surgery,Will I be able to feel anything during the surgery?,- What kind of anesthesia will I have? <br>- Will I be awake at all? <br>- Is it possible to wake up during the operation?,"No, you will be completely asleep under general anesthesia. You will not feel or remember anything about the procedure itself. Our anesthesia team will be monitoring you closely the entire time to ensure you are safe and comfortable."
microdiscectomy,Risks & Complications,What is the chance the disc will herniate again?,- Could this problem come back? <br>- How likely is a re-herniation? <br>- Can the disc slip again after surgery?,There is a 5 to 10 percent chance that the same disc could herniate again in the future. Following your post-operative restrictions and using good body mechanics for lifting can help reduce this risk.
microdiscectomy,Risks & Complications,What is a spinal fluid leak?,"- You mentioned a dural tear, what is that? <br>- Is a CSF leak dangerous? <br>- What happens if the sac around the nerves is torn?","The nerves in your spine are contained in a sac filled with spinal fluid. It's possible, though rare (about a 3% chance), for this sac to get nicked during surgery, causing a leak. It is not dangerous and is usually repaired right away during the procedure. It may require you to lie flat for a day or two after surgery to ensure it heals completely."
microdiscectomy,Risks & Complications,How will you protect my nerves during surgery?,- Is there a risk of nerve damage? <br>- What do you do to make sure the nerves are safe? <br>- Can the surgery make my leg pain worse?,"Nerve injury is the risk we take most seriously, but it is extremely rare, occurring in less than 1 in 1,000 surgeries. We use a microscope for a magnified view and very precise instruments. The goal is to gently free the nerve from pressure, and we handle it with the utmost care."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,How soon will my leg pain be gone?,- Will I wake up without pain? <br>- When will the sciatica stop? <br>- Is the relief from leg pain immediate?,"Most patients notice an immediate and significant relief of their leg pain right after they wake up from surgery. It's important to remember that the nerve has been pinched and needs time to heal, so some residual numbness or tingling can take a few weeks to fully disappear."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,Will I need a walker or a cane?,- Will I have trouble walking after surgery? <br>- Do I need any special equipment at home? <br>- Can I walk on my own right away?,The vast majority of patients are able to walk on their own without any assistance shortly after surgery. We will have you up and walking before you leave the hospital. A walker or cane is not typically needed.
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,How should I sleep?,- What is the best sleeping position after back surgery? <br>- Can I sleep on my stomach? <br>- Do I need a special pillow?,"The best positions are on your back with a pillow under your knees, or on your side with a pillow between your knees. This helps keep your spine in a neutral, comfortable position. We advise against sleeping on your stomach."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,When can I go back to work?,- How much time do I need to take off? <br>- What is the recovery time before returning to my job? <br>- When am I cleared to work again?,"This depends on the type of work you do. If you have a desk job, you may be able to return in as little as one to two weeks. If your job is more physically demanding, you may need six weeks for moderate duty and up to three months for heavy labor."
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,When can I resume sexual activity?,- Is it safe to have sex after my surgery? <br>- How long should I wait to be intimate? <br>- Are there any restrictions on sexual relations?,You can typically resume sexual activity whenever you feel comfortable. Listen to your body and avoid positions that cause pain or strain your back. The safest position is generally lying flat on your back.
microdiscectomy,After Surgery,Will I need to wear a back brace?,- Do I get a brace after this surgery? <br>- Is a back support required? <br>- Will you be fitting me for a brace?,"No, a back brace is not typically needed after a standard microdiscectomy."
microdiscectomy,Pain Management,How much pain will I be in after the surgery?,- Is the recovery very painful? <br>- What is the post-op pain like? <br>- How bad does it hurt after the operation?,"You will have some ""incisional"" pain at the site of the surgery, which is different from the nerve pain you had before. This is normal and well-controlled with the pain medication we prescribe. Most patients find this surgical soreness manageable and it improves significantly over the first few days."
microdiscectomy,Pain Management,For how long will I need to take narcotic pain medicine?,- How long will I be on the strong pain pills? <br>- When can I switch to Tylenol? <br>- Do most people need narcotics for weeks?,"Most patients only need to take the narcotic pain medication for a few days, up to a week. We encourage you to switch to over-the-counter Tylenol as soon as your pain allows."
microdiscectomy,Pain Management,What are the side effects of the pain medication?,- Do the pain pills make you sick? <br>- What should I watch out for with narcotics? <br>- Are there common problems with the pain medicine?,"The most common side effects of narcotic pain medications are drowsiness, nausea, and constipation. It is very important to take a stool softener while you are taking them to avoid constipation. Do not drive or operate machinery while taking them."
microdiscectomy,Activity & Recovery,When can I shower?,- How long do I have to wait to wash? <br>- Is the incision waterproof? <br>- Can I get my back wet?,"You can shower two or three days after your surgery. You should let the water run over the incision but avoid scrubbing it. After, gently pat the area dry. You should not take a bath or go swimming for about six weeks."
microdiscectomy,Activity & Recovery,"What does ""no bending, lifting, or twisting"" really mean?",- Can you give me examples of what I can't do? <br>- How strict are the BLT restrictions? <br>- What movements should I avoid?,"It means you should not bend at the waist to pick things up, lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk (about 8-10 lbs), or twist your torso like you're swinging a golf club. When you need to pick something up, bend with your knees and keep your back straight."
microdiscectomy,Activity & Recovery,When can I start exercising again?,- When can I go back to the gym? <br>- What kind of exercise is safe to do? <br>- How soon can I work out?,"Walking is your most important exercise, and you should start right away. You can gradually increase your distance. We will likely prescribe physical therapy a few weeks after surgery to guide you in strengthening your core. More strenuous gym activities are usually not permitted until after the six-week mark."
microdiscectomy,Activity & Recovery,How much walking should I do?,- What's a good walking goal after surgery? <br>- Is it possible to walk too much? <br>- Can you give me a walking schedule?,"Start with short, frequent walks inside your home for the first week. By the third week, you should aim for about half a mile per day, and by the fourth week, up to a mile per day. It's best to break this up into several shorter walks. Listen to your body; if you feel sharp pain, it's time to rest."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,What happens at my first follow-up appointment?,- What should I expect at my two-week check-up? <br>- Why do I need to come back after two weeks? <br>- What is the purpose of the first post-op visit?,"The first appointment, usually two weeks after surgery, is primarily a wound check. We'll inspect your incision to make sure it's healing well. It's also a great opportunity for you to ask any questions that have come up since you've been home."
microdiscectomy,Follow-Up,"Will I need more imaging, like an MRI?",- Do I need another MRI after surgery? <br>- Will you take x-rays? <br>- How do you check if the surgery worked?,"We do not typically need to get another MRI after surgery unless new symptoms develop. We may take an x-ray at your follow-up appointments, but the best way to know the surgery was successful is the relief of your leg symptoms."
acdf,About the Procedure,Will I be able to feel the plate and screws in my neck?,- Is the hardware noticeable? <br>- Can you feel the metal plate under the skin? <br>- Will the plate set off metal detectors?,"No, you will not be able to feel the plate and screws. They are very low-profile and are placed deep beneath your muscles. They will not set off metal detectors at the airport."
acdf,About the Procedure,Will my neck be stiff forever?,- How much motion will I lose in my neck? <br>- Will I still be able to turn my head? <br>- Does a fusion mean my neck won't move?,"This is a very common concern. For a one or two-level fusion, most patients notice very little, if any, change in their overall range of neck motion. The majority of your neck's rotation comes from the very top of your spine, which we are not operating on."
acdf,About the Procedure,What is the plate made of?,- What kind of metal is used in the hardware? <br>- Is the plate titanium? <br>- Can I have an allergic reaction to the metal?,"The plate and screws are made of medical-grade titanium alloy. This material is extremely biocompatible, and allergic reactions are incredibly rare. It is very strong and safe for use inside the body."
acdf,About the Procedure,Does this surgery put stress on the other discs?,- Will I have problems with other levels later? <br>- Does fusing one level cause issues above or below? <br>- What is adjacent segment disease?,"Fusing a level can place slightly more stress on the discs above and below the fusion. While many people never have a problem, it is possible that this can accelerate the wear and tear on those adjacent discs over time, which might require treatment in the future."
acdf,The Surgery,How long does an ACDF surgery take?,- How many hours is the ACDF operation? <br>- What is the surgical time? <br>- How long will I be in the operating room?,"The surgery for a single-level ACDF usually takes about 60 to 90 minutes. If more than one level is being fused, it will take a bit longer."
acdf,The Surgery,What is neuromonitoring?,- How do you monitor my spinal cord? <br>- What is that procedure that keeps my nerves safe? <br>- Can you explain the nerve monitoring?,Neuromonitoring is a safety measure we use during surgery. A specialist monitors the function of your spinal cord and nerves in real-time while you are asleep. This gives us immediate feedback and helps us protect your spinal cord from injury throughout the entire procedure.
acdf,The Surgery,Will I have a drain in my neck?,- What is the tube coming out of my incision? <br>- Why is there a drain? <br>- How long does the drain stay in?,"Yes, it's common to have a small, temporary drain placed next to the incision. This helps remove any excess fluid that can collect after surgery, which reduces swelling and pressure. The drain is usually removed by your nurse the morning after surgery, before you go home."
acdf,Risks & Complications,What are the chances my voice will be hoarse?,- Is it common to have a raspy voice? <br>- Could the surgery permanently affect my voice? <br>- Why does my throat feel funny?,A temporary hoarseness or a raspy voice is quite common after ACDF. This happens because the nerve that controls your vocal cords is very close to the surgical area and can get stretched or irritated. This almost always resolves within a few days or weeks. Permanent voice change is very rare.
acdf,Risks & Complications,Is it possible the bones won't fuse?,"- What happens if the fusion doesn't take? <br>- What is a ""non-union""? <br>- How likely is it that the bones don't heal together?","A ""non-union,"" where the bones fail to fuse, is a possible but uncommon complication. The risk is much higher for people who smoke. If a non-union does occur and causes symptoms, another surgery may be needed to get the bones to heal properly."
